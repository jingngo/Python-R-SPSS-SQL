"1","2024-11-25",1732572464,"I have no idea what to do, hoping to get some advice. What would you do?","TLDR: I've been unemployed for a year and don't know what to do. I will answer any questions about my situation.  
  
I am a long-time lurker, but this is my first time creating an account and I need some solid advice.

Before I start, here's a little backstory: I am with someone who is in the army. It's her career, and I support it. I knew what I was getting into when I got with her. That said, I didn't know \*\*how\*\* difficult it'd be on my career. I didn't go the conventional route, I wasn't fortunate enough to go to college, so I worked dead-end jobs (numerous airport jobs, mainly out on the ramp), and I was breaking my back.

I learned about Year Up which involves six months of school at a community college and six months of an internship. I did well, got my internship at Salesforce, and thought this new career path would set me up for an amazing future. I went through their Business Operations course in South Seattle. My main goal was to become a project coordinator and work up to become a project manager. I enjoy working with groups of people of different skill sets, accomplishing goals we set, and just learning how to manage teams effectively.

I interned at Salesforce for 6 months as a UX Project Coordinator Intern. It went great, but ultimately there wasn't a budget for new employees at my level. Cool. I got a letter of recommendation (I found out the hard way that these don't matter anymore, I guess I was born too late for these to hold weight.) Fast forward, I worked at Cisco for 4 months just to get a paycheck and pay the bills. The job wasn't something I wanted to do long-term, I was a recruitment coordinator.

I eventually accepted an offer at Accenture as a Project Manager but was affected by company-wide layoffs a year later. At this point, I'm with my girlfriend in El Paso TX (she's stationed at Fort Bliss) and I land at ADP as an Implementation Project Manager. As soul-sucking of a company as they are, I stuck it out until I brought up the fact that my girlfriend is in the army and wondered if I could work remotely. I was told no and they let me go (after just 4 months and after my manager said he'd work with me on getting a remote role). The reason I brought up my situation so late into the role is because in my experience, if I mention something that could affect employment down the line, I get rejected. I have always been in survival mode and will omit information if it means I get to at least have a steady income for a short while.

My problem is this: It's been a year since I've had a job. My girlfriend is getting a bit annoyed that I haven't found a job and probably thinks I'm slacking, and can't for the life of her understand why I'm having a hard time finding jobs. I showed her my email full of ""Thank you for applying, but..."" and ""Although your resume was great, we unfortunately..."" but she still doesn't get it. We are in Watertown NY now and I've resorted to applying to Sam's Club, Lowe's, Walmart, and similar places as stockers, sales associates, cart returners, etc, and have been rejected by every single one. I don't have a degree but have experience.

I was sold a dream that with Year Up, I wouldn't need a degree. I have come to the conclusion that I'm too experienced for retail jobs but not experienced enough for entry-level professional jobs. I have been unemployed for 1 year and I don't see a light at the end of the tunnel.","careerguidance",0,"https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1gzvfqv/i_have_no_idea_what_to_do_hoping_to_get_some/",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Hey 27F have an Associates in IT but I haven't worked in IT since 2019 and tbh I don't even feel passionate about IT to pursue a career in it anymore. 

I've been doing warehouse jobs ever since, but I just got laid off. Now I want to do something like actually have a career in something. I'm very organized, I love planning events and getting people together, im a great communicator, I love people, and I learn new things fairly quickly. I'm bilingual too. I have had an interest in forensic psychology and ASL as well. 

 I know there's many possibilities for which path to take but I'd love to hear what the people have to say! I'm not opposed to going back to school, but I just feel torn and depressed since the whole lay off ordeal.

Keep that in mind. Many people are experiencing this. Just keep going, keep applying. Try not to become attached to a job. 

You may also want to reach out to people who may already have a job youd be interested in. Ask them how they broke in. 

Most of finding a new job is just a matter of putting yourself out there. You have a little business, that business is you, so youre going to have to market yourself, and dont give up until you reach your goal. 

You got this!!!! Try a strategy for a week, if its not working, pick another strategy, optimize each process. This is how business works.","1"

I plan to work from home this week (and would need to notify my team). As I recently accepted the job, I was not originally planning to wfh this week. 

I am putting in my two weeks, however, my manager is not going to be back for another week. My team is expecting me in the office. Would you go above and tell her manager to begin the two week process and can then advise the team that you are wfh and putting in notice? Or advise the team you are wfh and then begin two weeks when the manager gets back next Monday? 

Never quit a job before so want to make sure Im doing this correctly, least bridges burned as possible.

However, there isn't an ideal timing for you to give that notice, it would actually be better late than never. Also, don't forget that your next employer is waiting for you to start when you can unless they are really flexible with it, which is a rare case. Start worrying about your next employer vs. the current one you're going to leave. 

The reason why I'm saying that is because I don't want you to potentially lose your next opportunity by trying to be considerate of your current job. I'm not sure how your relationship with your current manager is but regardless how you say it, it may just be burning a bridge. 

Best of luck and congrats!","1"

Hi All

I am located in New Zealand and am having a hard time finding out what to do in terms of a career. I am currently enrolled in a counselling degree although I found it really hard to even attend classes as my social anxiety would ramp up and I would start sweating and eventually avoiding. I also abuse cannabis, and have depressive symptoms as well as anxiety and so I have withdrawn from life. I have no clue what to do with my life&I feel as if everyone wants me to have things together but I am really struggling to find a direction. On top of this I am soon turning 30 and I feel as if time is running out.

I am receiving therapy which should help, although I am beginning practicum in a few months and have come to a point where I need to re-evaluate what I am doing. A potential option I have landed upon is medical imaging technician (X - Ray, CT scan etc) I am pretty clueless about that line of work, but if anyone has any info about it or any alternative pathways, I would really appreciate some help.

Whatever you come up with you are likely going to need a doctor's note to corroborate. Depending on where you are, company policy, etc

2. How bad do you want this karma? I would usually say the tried and true ""slipped in the shower"" as sicknesses are tricky, major injuries are hard to fake, but getting a concussion and some bruised ribs is no laughing matter and hard to visually disprove.

3. Worse karma, death in the family. Again, little need for documentation as nobody is likely to call you a liar to your face for an excuse like that.

4. You've already messed up by requesting the dates off. If you don't get the time off approved and you still don't show up then that's red flags for days. 

5. Depending on your status at your job, being honest is the way to go. People can bluff and bluster and yes, a request for time off is still a \*request\*, but employees will often treat it as a ""notice that I will be gone.""","4"

"39","2024-11-25",1732567669,"I [F27] am 8 months unemployed, considering a career change at this point; how should I go about finding a new direction, especially if I don't think I'm good at anything?","# Professional Background

I'm in the US. I graduated back in 2021 with a bachelor's in math. After 6 months, I applied for an ""entry level data analyst"" role with this AI startup and was hired. After being hired, my role was changed to solutions engineering. Essentially, my role meant I was the bridge between clients and the company's tech. That involved:

1. Building custom solutions for clients using the company's software
2. Supporting the sales team with product demonstrations and technical presentations 
3. Prototyping new features to expand out the company's product offerings 

Most days involved me programming in Python, using and managing Docker containers, managing repos with git, automating some repeated tasks with Bash scripting, etc. I can go into more detail in comments if that's helpful.  

# Reflections on my experience at the startup

I'll be honest: I sucked at the job. I was checked out by month 2 of my employment there after I was put on a fake project. My team spent weeks working on something under the pretense that the project was absolutely essential for the company, only to be told after completion that the whole project was just a ""test of how well the team works together."" I found it hard to take the job seriously after that. I basically resigned myself to doing the least amount of work possible to simply avoid being fired. 

Obviously, looking back, I highly regret that behavior. I should have still given the job 100%. Not for the company's sake, but so that I could upskill and become more competent. And so that my peers and teammates could have good things to say about me; professional reputation and networking is everything, as I've learned. I should have also been actively looking for a different job. Ultimately, though, I didn't and I stuck around to the bitter end: the company closed down in April of this year. The founder went off to a different company and took some of the workers he liked with him, I was not one of them. Can't exactly blame him. 


# General reflections on my work experience 

I'll be even more honest: I've sucked at every job I've ever held. I've never been fired, but I've also never excelled. 

1. I worked as a math tutor at my university, but I was frankly an awful communicator and am not very quick on my feet. As in, students would ask me questions that I'd have no answer to, or would only have an answer to if I locked myself in a quiet room and worked the problem out myself with pen and paper. 

2. I also worked at a fast food restaurant (subway shop) during semester breaks and would almost instantaneously forget customer orders, while my coworkers seemed to have no trouble remembering multiple orders and multitasking in real time. I just couldn't hold on to and manage that much information in real time, and coordinate that with actually making the orders. I was often moved to register duty and it felt humiliating because working the registers was what you did if you couldn't do the other tasks well. 

3. I worked as an online math tutor part time after graduation, just as a stopgap while finding full time work. I equally sucked at that, and I especially sucked at quickly entering all the student data in between tutoring sessions. I'm a slow reader, and have always had a hard time comprehending and interpreting the meaning in words, written or spoken, in real time. 


# Issues that have followed me everywhere  

- Slow processing speeds 

- Weak working memory

- Issues with maintaining focus

These issues are the bane of my existence. It made me suffer quite a bit in my more advanced math lectures. I graduated with a decent enough GPA (~3.7 truncated, 3.8 if you wanted to round up), but my whole life was consumed by studying. I felt like I had to spend all my free time compensating for my shitty cognitive abilities. 


# How these issues followed me post-graduation

These issues were a major reason why I sucked at my first and only post-graduation role at that AI startup. Because even when I did put an effort in to be a productive part of the team, the rest of my team didn't seem to value or care about any of the work or contributions I tried to provide. There were times where I really did try, but my efforts would prove fruitless, and I'd go back to doing the bare minimum. Some examples of the issues I encountered:

- I was an awful communicator: try as I might, I couldn't form and convey coherent thoughts during things like brainstorming meetings and client demonstrations.

- I could tell that people were always waiting for me to shut up in meetings so that the ""adults could talk."" Things I said never made an impact. I struggled to keep up during meetings. I struggled to generate new ideas or solutions so that I could be a useful part of brainstorming sessions.

- I was slow with my technical work and spent too much time obsessing over relatively minor details and would miss the big picture. I'd regularly make ""careless"" mistakes (careless in quotes because they really weren't careless, I would make these mistakes even while trying my hardest) that slowed down my workflow and progress. It would be things like spending time debugging an error that only came about because I forgot to start a Docker container. 

- The code I'd provide would basically never make it to a final product. The only time I was able to have any real impact on anything was when I was on a client contract and was basically the only one working on it. Try as I might, I was always missing the point somehow. 


# How I tried to solve these issues

The issue with my processing speed and focus bothered me so much I tried getting tested for ADHD back while I was still a college student. The results of that testing was that, while there was some evidence of attentional issues and relative weaknesses in my cognitive abilities, it wasn't enough to support a diagnosis. What stood out to me the most was the results of the IQ test they gave me: very high verbal intelligence, but average or barely above average in everything else. To be fair, I only had 3 hours of sleep before that appointment. So, that might have brought the other scores down, but frankly those scores track with my own observations.  

I had a coworker who would occasionally give me some of his extra adderall, and taking it would suddenly and dramatically improve my abilities and productivity. I'm a bit devastated to know that there's a pill out there that apparently solves so many of the problems that hold me back, and yet my attempts at acquiring it have been completely futile. I plan on pursuing a second opinion for the ADHD diagnosis. 

I also recently learned that both of my parents have experienced sleep apnea. I wish I knew that while I still had decent health insurance, because I've long struggled with feeling well-rested, regardless of how long I sleep. Frankly, sleeping 5 or 6 hours feels just the same as sleeping 7, 8, 9, 10, etc. It literally does not matter how long I sleep and how good my sleep schedule is, I can't remember the last time I didn't wake up feeling like I got hit in the head. I'd look up my symptoms and get ""sleep apnea"" as a potential explanation, but I dismissed the idea because I'm not in a high-risk demographic for that disease. Knowing I actually have a family history of the disease makes it more likely that this may explain why I always feel tired and like I'm running on empty.

The even more frustrating thing is that I do know for sure that I have a condition that negatively affects cognition and productivity: Hashimoto's thyroiditis. However, my doctors have always refused prescribing anything for it as my TSH levels are in the normal range. I got frustratingly close to getting a prescription last month, but the doctor changed her mind and wanted me to redo my bloodwork first.

# Alternative careers?

I'm considering trying to see if I can get a teaching job, but my previous experience with tutoring makes me doubt I'd ever be good at that. I apparently even suck at restaurant jobs. Like, what's out there for someone like me? I thought the world of tech would be suitable for someone like myself who works better ""in the background"", but my fruitless job search has made me seriously doubt I'll ever land another tech job. 

I just don't know if there are any career paths where I wouldn't run into the same frustrations, due to these significant cognitive issues that hold me back. I've suffered in school, I suffered at every job I've ever held. Nothing speaks louder than your old boss, who worked closely with you for 3 years, inviting all your coworkers to join him at his new company but specifically excluding you. I feel like a midwit, and even slower than a midwit. You should see me try to learn a new board game, or even do bingo, or hold a coversation, or just navigate new or real-time situations in general. I'm embarassingly slow at everything. It holds me back in every facet of my life and I feel destined to fail at anything I try. I literally feel insecure when people criticize Joe Biden's speaking ability, because I'm about as bad as he is, and I don't have the excuse of old age. I'm a slow person who was tricked into feeling smart because I could do okay in school. But doing well in school turns out to be pretty irrelevant to actually doing well at making an actual fucking living or even functioning socially on a basic level.

I don't even know if I'm capable of minimum wage work. Like, I could barely do well working at a fucking fast food restaurant.

I graduated with a master's in French language in 2022 and I went into a job teaching French at an immersion school. Long story short, it wasn't a great job and it made me question a number of things. Ive been working in the public sector in the American government for just over a year now, trying to figure out what to do next.

I have a strong desire to go abroad. I have near-native fluency in French, so francophone areas interest me, as does China as I'm currently learning mandarin. The problem I'm running up against is that it seems that the only jobs available to me are English teaching jobs, which in addition to not necessarily having much mobility, aren't something I'm especially enthusiastic about. If I were to be a teacher again, I feel like I would have to be in a school environment that prioritizes work-life balance and pays somewhat well, or at the very least is in an area with low cost of living, and it feels like I'm unlikely to find that most places.

I'm considering applying to PhD programs in Canada, both because that can fast track citizenship and because it might get me the qualifications I would need to break into a new field. The difficulty is knowing which field would be A). Interesting for me, and B). Profitable and/or worth it in the long term.

I feel that I'm very talented with languages, I'm often told that my French (particularly my accent) is so good that I sound native, and I'm picking up Mandarin very quickly.

I may sound like I'm rambling, but that's because I have my mind in a lot of different places as I figure out where to look next.

Employers don't like the ""owning your own company"" thing because it feels like you're going not going to focus 100% on the job and focus more on your own business. To be honest, you should be focusing on your own company more because it's YOURS, but employers care about their own best self interests, not their employees. If it's something like gig work, it's part time and can be done anytime so it matters way less. 

Self employment can also mean so many things from working gig work like you mentioned or having a full side business along with your full time job. Hence, it's just best not to mention it unless your self employment work is some sort of freelancing work that is relevant to your job when you weren't employed. 

For example, I work full time and own a resume writing/career coaching business on the side, there's no way I would mention that in my resume since employers might think it's a conflict of interest.

Would make only $0-50k the first 2 years most likely, living on a $40-50k draw (loaned salary you pay back). **Everything sounds great except that initial pay cut.** Industry is super interesting to me, working with best friend, super successful boss as a mentor who is also a nice guy, and a less corporate atmosphere where I can make my own schedule.

To make things more complicated, **I just got word that I should be receiving an offer for a job I've been interviewing for on the side, to stay fully remote but do exactly what I do now at a competitor for 20k more ($140k total)**. The guy who would be my boss there seems cool too, but the thought of continuing to settle for the same thing I haven't loved, and be complacent in return for comfort makes me a little sad.

Overall - my gut is telling me to turn down the job offer for what I do now, and take the leap into something that actually excites/motivates me. The long term seems more rewarding in industrial real estate because of the unlimited pay potential, autonomy, and ability to learn from someone great before they retire. I'm thankful for the years I've had in comfort, but I'm ready for more growth outside my comfort zone. The first few years will suck, but it seems worth it if I can stick it through.

**Am I crazy for leaning this way?** I do feel like I just reached a level of financial stability where I can start to live good, settle down with a girl soon and buy a house. However, I feel like I'll always think ""what-if"" and I've always felt capable of more than what I do now.

I have 2 friends in this. 1 of them had their $50k draw forgiven. The other didn't but both broke $100k in year 3, and $200k in year 5 or later. Both of their direct bosses are multi-millionaires who barely work anymore.

In my field, and almost any corporate job, to make just $300k+ you are working your tail off 50-60+ hours a week and absoutely miserable. From what I hear and see in my own research, that's not the case at all in this industry as you get more established. So the long-term feels like it might be worth it still, even if I burn most my savings to get there.

Also - some people quit their jobs to go back to school and earn $0 for years, taking on debt in the meantime. I see this as similar without the student loans.","1_2_1_1"

You can make a lot in analytics too considering youre only 7 years in, look for ways to reach director or VP, and/or pivot to another dept that interests you more. Two years without pay will deplete your savings completely as well as contribute nothing to your 401k for two years of earning potential. 

Even without rent if you move in with your parents, that money will go quick. What if you try this new venture and dislike it too? Also depleting your savings, while also hoping to buy a home within 4-5 years seems contradictory. 

Take the new, higher earning offer, look for ways to increase your pay in something you already have experience in and see how that goes. You could always  since you seem ambitious and have no kids, mortgage, or partner  see if you could somehow do both. Maybe full time analytics job and part time real estate.

Logically, you are acting stupid. You are passing up a great paying job w/ alot of benefits for a passion project. Emotionally, this is a lot more complicated.

I get the dead end job feeling. You have 30 more years to go &amp; the last thing you want is to feel miserable waking up every day. But is that because of your job or because you have intervertally isolated yourself. You have a stay at home job &amp; sound like no one at home. Are you going out with friends frequently? Pursuing hobbies w/ others? You need at least 1 hr being in another location doing something you enjoy. If you don't, you will feel awful.

However, you won't be the first to give up a great career for passion, the problem is we only ever see the success stories. It is a risk, drastically different from your current job, &amp; will take a long time to become stable. I would at the very least shadow you friend for a week or two to get the feeling of the prospective job.

TLDR: I would sit down and introspect on what you really want out of your future. Passion in job or Passion in hobby that job supports. Stable life (wife, kids, house) or Living it up (Travel, Friends, Exploring). Not every life is for every one. This is a purely emotional question &amp; only you can really answer it.","3"

The isolation from remote work is real and I do try to actively counter it as much as I can by being around others or doing a hobby when not working. I have a serious girlfriend, a good group of friends, and too many hobbies to count (cycling, tennis, golf, lifting, shooting guns, hiking, etc) which really helps. 

I won't say IRE is a passion, but an interesting and exciting opportunity to re-invent myself, grow my network, work hard with a great friend, and set myself up for a greater future if I can stick it out. We're both very entrepreneurial, and have always wanted to start a business together... he has said to me this could be the beginning of that before we start our own brokerage or invest in IRE ourselves down the road. I see the vision too, and everyone I talk to in his industry just seems overall more happy than 99% of the people I know in corporate.","3_1"

My friend earns $150-250k a year now, but it took him (and everyone else in the industry I've talked to) about 3 years to break $100k which is where I'm at now. Would make only $0-50k the first 2 years most likely, living on a $40-50k draw (loaned salary you pay back). **Everything sounds great except that initial pay cut.** Industry is super interesting to me, working with best friend, super successful boss as a mentor who is also a nice guy, and a less corporate atmosphere where I can make my own schedule.

**Am I crazy for leaning this way?** I do feel like I just reached a level of financial stability where I can start to live good, settle down with a girl soon and buy a house. However, I feel like I'll always think ""what-if"" and I've always felt capable of more than what I do now.

With mixed success. Now in high ticket. Sometimes it's an interview/intern style process (from both sides) which should follow with some security either in commitments, draw, salary + commission or some success. I cap those engagements to 90 days before moving forward or cutting my losses. And it's always part-time.

They should understand as grown men that we can't afford to go without income for extended periods, whether it's them or someone else cutting the check. If it's truly performance based (commission only) with an existing business, then they should be able to provide a path to success based on historic data. I.e. ""at the bare minimum, the average nitwit can get x amount of output for x amount of input over x amount of time. You can use that as a reference over 90 days to gauge whether or not they're full of it. If they don't have that, don't take them seriously. If they're serious, then a willingness to invest in you by the bare due diligence with some hand holding or draw expresses good faith. When push comes to shove, if someone won't even put a contract in front of you, they're bluffing.

What incentive does your buddy have in letting you into the owner's book that he's supposed to inherit? What incentive does the owner have in giving you his book? Is he taking an override? All of this should be discussed before you leave your six figure role for chasing dragons. What's your upside? $60k additional gross after 3 years of no income? NO THANKS.

If you're still not dissuaded, then offer to work with them on the prospecting side and take a % on deals. They should be able to cut you in for the value of that, which at the very least offers a win-win by filling their pipeline and let's you investigate the offer plus some spiffs without quitting your day job. If they're impossible to deal with during that time, then they're not serious. And $30M in commissions, but he can't cut a check for a stipend (at least minimum wage) to see you through the feeling-out process? F\*ck that.

Which type of commercial properties are we talking about and do you have the actual industry knowledge to be effective at understanding the needs of a call center vs. medical office vs. solo practitioner?

To make things more complicated, **I just got word that I should be receiving an offer for a job I've been interviewing for on the side, to stay fully remote but do exactly what I do now at a competitor for 20k more ($140k total)**. The guy who would be my boss there seems cool too, but the thought of continuing to settle for the same thing I haven't loved, and be complacent in return for comfort makes me a little sad.

Overall - my gut is telling me to turn down the job offer for what I do now, and take the leap into something that actually excites/motivates me. The long term seems more rewarding in industrial real estate because of the unlimited pay potential, autonomy, and ability to learn from someone great before they retire. I'm thankful for the years I've had in comfort, but I'm ready for more growth outside my comfort zone. The first few years will suck, but it seems worth it if I can stick it through.

**Am I crazy for leaning this way?** I do feel like I just reached a level of financial stability where I can start to live good, settle down with a girl soon and buy a house. However, I feel like I'll always think ""what-if"" and I've always felt capable of more than what I do now.

I have $50k in savings, $40k in retirement.**

Basically, **I've been in corporate analytics for 7 years now**. For the last 4 years, I've been fully remote and earning $100-120k total comp. This job was never something I really set out to do, but just kind of found myself in and kept going. The type of job where you sit in front of a screen all day, every day. My new boss sucks now and I need to get out ASAP , so I've been interviewing and weighing my options. However, **even when I had a great boss, I always found myself bored, unmotivated, and feeling like I was capable of more than being behind a screen all day. I also just can't stand the corporate atmosphere anymore.** It's not me at all. I'll save my rant on that for another post.

Long story short - my best friend I've known my entire life has been an **industrial real estate broker** for as long as I've been in my career and he absolutely loves it. Opposite of corporate atmosphere too, very entrepreneurial with freedom once you get established. After I vented to him about my situation, he told me to consider joining his team and learning the industry. Loves his boss, introduced us, **boss gave me the green light to join their team** if I choose to after we had a coffee chat. This **boss is a lifelong industry veteran who has earned over $30M in career commissions, and is looking for someone to help my friend for when he passes off his book of business and retires in 3-4 years**. My friend earns $150-250k a year now, but it took him (and everyone else in the industry I've talked to) about 3 years to break $100k which is where I'm at now. Would make only $0-50k the first 2 years most likely, living on a $40-50k draw (loaned salary you pay back). **Everything sounds great except that initial pay cut.** Industry is super interesting to me, working with best friend, super successful boss as a mentor who is also a nice guy, and a less corporate atmosphere where I can make my own schedule.

To make things more complicated, **I just got word that I should be receiving an offer for a job I've been interviewing for on the side, to stay fully remote but do exactly what I do now at a competitor for 20k more ($140k total)**. The guy who would be my boss there seems cool too, but the thought of continuing to settle for the same thing I haven't loved, and be complacent in return for comfort makes me a little sad.

Overall - my gut is telling me to turn down the job offer for what I do now, and take the leap into something that actually excites/motivates me. The long term seems more rewarding in industrial real estate because of the unlimited pay potential, autonomy, and ability to learn from someone great before they retire. I'm thankful for the years I've had in comfort, but I'm ready for more growth outside my comfort zone. The first few years will suck, but it seems worth it if I can stick it through.

**Am I crazy for leaning this way?** I do feel like I just reached a level of financial stability where I can start to live good, settle down with a girl soon and buy a house. However, I feel like I'll always think ""what-if"" and I've always felt capable of more than what I do now.

The way career paths typically go is you get paid poorly for a few years (maybe up to 10 depending on field) and then you start bringing in big bucks. You have to start somewhere, making typically less money, to get to the high salaries. 

You can always serve part time while building experience, or serve while going to school or classes, at the very least do certificates in something you think you are interested in and try to get jobs in that industry.

Mostly serving tables and bartending. I now run a team for a health insurance company.

There are a TON of transferable skills that aren't necessarily ""resume"" skills. Communication, public speaking, multitasking, etc. 

I will say I worked in restaurants forever because I was going to school and also my life was a roller coaster. It's a fantastic way to make enough money to pay your school, bills, rent etc. and only work 25-35 hours a week and the hours don't directly conflict with school hours. I also think it's not the worst place to end up working - you can live/move ANYWHERE and make a livable wage, but as others have said, it's always the best career long term.

One day you will likely take a pay cut, but it'll end up giving you benefits (401k, health, vision, dental, PTO, etc.) and then eventually you'll end up making more. 

I can confidently say I look back and realize that working in restaurants was one of the most fun times of my life. Lots of freedom, lots of friends, lots of fun and goofing. Enjoy it. Become OK with the fact that you're making good money at 23 and if you go to school, get comfortable being there a while during school years and build good relationships for shifts/swaps/etc.","12"

You sound like you want more meaning to your life and purpose. I'll tell you now that the easy money doesn't last forever. If you enjoy being a waiter and aspects of it cool. Work your way up the chain! I have friends that worked in restaurants for a minute, moved up, and became manager. Some of them like it some don't. The one's that don't often find themselves limited to what they can do next with their experience. 

  
I highly suggest you get a degree/trade school. One thing I realize now that I didn't realize before is that piece of paper will open doors for you. During this financial crisis of 2023-2024 job searching has been extremely picky with their applicants. Even though I was more than qualified in my industry many applications required a degree. 

  
Life is unpredictable &amp; getting an education never hurts. Just make sure you get a degree in something worth pursuing. Good luck with everything and cheers brother","13"

If you want to be a financial advisor, start studying and get your certifications while you stay employed as a server.  

After you get your Series 63-Uniform Securities Agent State Law Exam and your FINRA series 6 and series 7, Get your CFP certification.

Some Firms require certification to sell Life Insurance wich is a state licensing for ""Life, Accident, &amp; Health"" (LA&amp;H).

There may be other requirements by the employer.   

Some companies will hire you and have a training program which includes the tests for the certifications. Financially, this is the way to go for someone just starting out. Look at careers on a site like Fidelity to get a better idea.

Same approach with a trade.
Identify what you might want to do, look into licensing and certifications.  Keep your current job until you can make a clean move.

Best of luck.","18"

In that time I've researched all kinds of jobs and finally think I'm ready to make a move.

The problem with my degree was the study was too far removed from the reality of the industry, and there was no practical on-the-job experience.

Now I'm looking at studying just a 1 year course for a fraction of the cost of a degree. There will be practical experience from day 1, and I've already done a short course to get an idea of it as well.

If I was back at your age and without my degree debt, I would have a real good think about what work would match my personality type and values.

The thought of being here for the rest of my life is absolutely terrifying.  In fact, the thought has given me a new drive attempt to go to college again.

My original job offer promised an IT course and cert within six months of hire. The course never happened after multiple inquiries. 

Two years later they are now setting me up for a different IT course and cert and they want me to sign an agreement saying if I leave the job within 12 months of the course, I will have to pay back the pro-rated cost. 

In my opinion, if the promised original course had happened, I would have signed the same one year agreement and I would now be free and clear at this date. I think it would be fair for the company to waive the training agreement in this instance since they failed on their training promise which *was* a factor in me accepting the job. 

I don't have any concrete plans to leave this job but I do have a potential opportunity coming up (which I don't want them to know about) and if it comes through and I do decide to take it, I don't want to be on the hook for the $3k training. 

Thoughts or opinions? If it comes down to it, I *can* sell my PTO when I leave to cover the cost but I'd rather not, and again, I think it's only fair that they waive it since they failed in their original promise. I'm sure if my job offer outlined an agreement that I get a certain cert within 6 months of hire, and I failed to do so, they would have let me go or issued some sort of penalty so it's only fair it should go the other direction, right?


Basically, should I bother trying to get this waived or just not bother rocking the boat?","careerguidance",0,"https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1gzsqfe/my_job_offer_promised_a_classcert_within_6_months/",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Here's the problem - I joined my bachelor's in 2011 and haven't finished it yet. There's just one course left that I'm yet to clear and can't bring myself to go to the university to complete it.

All these years I went around trying to pursue my creative dreams such as filmmaking, writing, etc. I worked in a few startups in between and joined 2 corporate roles as well before I quit due to mental health issues. I'm looking to restart my career back in the EU. I need advice on what my chances are with the work visa and student visa (if at all I'm eligible for any course given my bachelor's degree is delayed).

Need help figuring out how do I apply for a work visa or if I need to finish my bachelor's and apply for another master's or if there's any other visa that can help me find a job in the EU.

I'm based out of India.

TLDR - Studying again requires a bachelor's degree, which I don't have. But I do have an EU master's degree, which I don't know if I can put to use.","careerguidance",0,"https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1gzslyc/how_do_i_proceed_from_here/",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"209","2024-11-25",1732564281,"Which IT job in 2025 would best suit a 44yo with a 2006 self taught PHP developer mindset?","Hi. I'm 44 and a self taught PHP developer who has barely touched web development professionally but need guidance.

Since I was 7 years old I tried to teach myself programming with C. The books and compilers I talked my parents into buying for me never got me to learn too much, probably because I was so young and not a genius.

As an adult I worked on F-16 aircraft in the USAF mainly because I wanted to leave my Dad's house and choose poorly to not wait for a computer programming opening. 

Through the years I delivered pizza, did much customer service work (which I was good at but hated and couldn't last past 6 months).

I did one contract role that renewed every 90 days for 18 months as a PHP developer. I taught myself PHP because he website I launched used PHP and the people I hired tried to ruin my website. That was in 2006. 

I attempted schooling but ran out of money for basic community college, and the courses I needed were offered once every two years, etc. 

Since then I've been mainly working manufacturing jobs where they will teach anyone, but the pay isn't great.

Now while unemployed, I am working on my candle making business and also 3D print some candle making tools for businesses, but one small order every few weeks isn't cutting it.

I would like to be able to do the next up and coming thing but web development isn't the same as in 1997 when I took my first HTML class. 

I know CSS very well, Javascript fairly well, and PHP/MySQL fairly well, but only enough for my own projects. 

Now (well, for years now) there is Laravel, and other frameworks for PHP as well as JavaScript frameworks, etc.

My friends kids who asked 15 years ago to borrow my PHP book now work in IT positions with Rockstar games, etc. Their parents put them through school, etc. My parents told me they had no money to help with schooling. 

I'm not blaming anyone, but at 44yo I feel I need to either shit or get off the pot.

My interest has always been websites since 1997, but there is too much to learn in my opinion in order to know everything with Composer and Linux, security, now AI, etc.

I am at a point that I will either learn one main thing and try to earn a decent living with that, or else continue with barely ends being met and finding a new job that will pay me $20/hr if I'm lucky and for the rest of my life be stuck juggling which bill to pay.

I am willing to go back to school if it means I won't struggle for the remainder of my life as much as I've been. 

What should I go back to school for? Java? C#, C++, AI? 

Also, are there any good online bootcamps that anyone on here would vouch for that would get me up and running through the door in a minimal amount of time?

I got an offer for £80k which is what i put as my expectations. When they sent the offer, i had a chance to review the benefits &amp; pension. I saw that the pension offered (9%) is less than my current (15%). I asked if they could increase the base salary by 2k to account for a portion of that difference. 

Is this unreasonable given that they offered my expected? I hadnt seen the benefits/pension before though. I did mention on the phone that it wasn't a deal breaker and the HR guy understood and said he would ask the question. He also said he would prep the documents and propose a start date. 

He said he would get back to me today but I've not heard back - I'm starting to worry.

I (42/f) came to the US almost 15 years ago. I got pregnant right away and now have 2 kids. I never went to school here. Mostly because I didn't know what I want to learn and also because the high college tuitions were putting me off.

This is what I have in mind.
1. Associate degree in a good paying job
2. Online or evening classes, because I can't afford to stop working (I am working as a special education teacher's aide)
3. A job where I can help people (i was looking into OTA, but unfortunately I can't find any online or evening classes. Nurse also isn't an option for me)

Consequently, their big plans to bring in an intern to learn and appreciate under others backfired when they realized they don't have the systems or infrastructure in place to train and support you. 

If this was a paid internship, there may have been a business impacting event (loss of client) that impacts their ability to pay you.

Sadly, their missteps have a great impact on you through no fault of your own. 

Not ideal, but consider that if this is how they conduct business and how they treat others, your better off not learning from them.

"273","2024-11-25",1732554990,"Anyone experienced in late career change?","Hi everyone,

Im hoping for some objective advice and kind responses as I navigate a pretty big career dilemma.

Im 32 years old and have been working in UX and design for over a decade. My journey into this field was somewhat accidental  in school, I was encouraged to pursue a creative career, and my parents insisted on a vocational path rather than going straight to university.

Although my employers have always been happy with my work, Ive been feeling increasingly disconnected from this career. I dont resonate with the themes or culture of this field. Technology, IT, apps, websites  while Im technically capable, I feel zero passion for these areas. Unlike many of my colleagues, I dont spend my free time reading about these topics or engaging with communities around them.

Whats been weighing on me most is the lack of tangible meaning in my work. It feels abstract and often overly focused on business and tech.

My partner works in medicine, and while he has his own frustrations about the job, I admire the depth and purpose of his work. He reads medical journals on weekends and seems engaged with his field in a way Ive never felt about mine.

On top of that, remote work has drained me. While its convenient, I miss being around people, and I find the endless corporate speak in my projects incredibly frustrating. I crave facts, substance, and an environment where I can feel like Im contributing something real.

Ive been seriously considering a career change for a while now, but the idea is daunting. Im unsure of where to even begin, what might align with my interests and values, and how to manage the financial and practical aspects of such a major shift.

Has anyone here successfully transitioned into a completely different field later in their career? Or do you know someone who has? How did you go about it, and what advice would you offer to someone in my position?

I understand that starting a new job is very overwhelming. But you are not panicking for absolutely no need. 

If your manager will talk to you tomorrow about this - its not about whether he likes you or doesnt like you. What you can say is that I understand the mistake I made. Thank you for pointing that out. I want to learn as much as I can and I will pay extra attention to this moving forward. Dont go into apologizing at all. Dont apologize. Instead you thank him for bringing this up with you. This is very very important. 

Literally everyone fucks up. Not one person has started anew job and not made mistakes. Going to apologize mode is a big mistake. Im a person who has had people report to me for most of my career. For me to point out something would be so that the same mistake wont happen again, I would appreciate 100% more the  thank you for telling and bring this up to my attention. I will pay extra attention moving forward so Im not going to repeat the same mistake again than apologies. The first response means that the person is taking responsibility and its learning opportunity. And thats literally all there is to it. 

Besides they have clearly stated that they are happy to have you there and believe in you. EVERYONE MAKES MISTAKES.","4"

Business the opportunities are endless. Id suggest finding something within business that sparks your interest, like finance, marketing etc, and from that seek work experience schemes and connecting with professionals via LinkdIn and gaining knowledge about specific job roles and what you can do to gain experience.

At your age its normal to not have loads of knowledge about business and what you actually want to do. A lot of the time thats what college is designed for.  

For me personally I went into uni majoring in philosophy and then decided to change to a joint honours in philosophy And politics. I dont know specifically what I want to do but Ive been interested in sustainability so paid for a 6 week online course with Oxford University in sustainable leadership. Online courses are very useful also, there are plenty of free ones and more in depth ones that can be pricey.

honestly both paths can be great - but here's the real deal: with how AI is transforming both industries, the traditional barriers between marketing and finance are becoming less rigid. for example, a lot of the complex math in finance is now handled by AI tools, while marketing is becoming more data-driven but also more creative.

if you hate math but love creativity, stick with marketing. here's why:

* marketing is evolving into a super creative field with AI handling the analytical heavy lifting
* you can always learn finance concepts later (especially with AI tools helping you understand complex topics)
* your natural creativity is actually becoming MORE valuable as AI takes over routine tasks

quick tip: start playing around with AI tools for both marketing and finance while youre still in school. they can help you understand both fields better and see which one clicks more with you. at my company we see marketing folks using AI for creative campaigns and finance people using it for complex calculations - its pretty cool seeing how both fields are evolving

but yeah if math gives you anxiety stick with marketing. your creative thinking will be worth gold, especially as AI continues to change the industry. just make sure to stay tech-savvy!","1"

The truth is, you dont need to be a math whiz to succeed in marketing, and with the rise of digital tools, you can thrive in areas like branding, content creation, social media strategy, or even UX research. That said, you will need to have a strong portfolio and internships. On the flip side, finance can lead to solid career opportunities too, but if you hate math, itll probably be a struggle, and you wont enjoy the work as much. Remember, both degrees can lead to fulfilling careers, but excelling in your field is easier if you actually like what youre doing.

To answer your other question, you can absolutely work in finance-related roles with a marketing degree, especially in areas like financial product marketing or sales.

They interview grads about their degree choices and career pivots, which could give you insight into how others navigated similar decisions.

"327","2024-11-25",1732551349,"Would you go for a job that pays less but offers more bonus incentives?","I've been in an intensive interview process with a company for nearly four months (but officialy unemployed as of two weeks ago by former employer) as they plan to open an office in my country. Throughout the process, senior management seemed very interested in me, and I received positive signals at every stage, making it seem like an offer was imminent. However, I later learned that the partners they plan to recruit prefer to bring in their own BD professional, someone theyve worked with before. Naturally, that meant I wasnt going to get that specific role.

After expressing how this situation blocked other opportunities I had on hold, they reconsidered and created a role for me. The issue now is the salary. Their first offer was **36% lower** than my previous salary. When I countered, they increased it slightly, but its still **10% less** than what I used to earn. They justified this by saying that while they value my experience and qualifications, the scope of the role is different from what Ive done before. They want me to develop business from a market thats relatively unknown to them and essentially ""prove myself"" in this capacity, which I understand.

That said, Ive been in the same industry for 5 years (in another law firm), and while the tasks are somewhat different, my overall work experience shouldnt be undervalued. I believe the base salary should reflect my qualifications and previous earnings, irrespective of the shift in focus. Theyve included performance-based bonuses, but the lower base pay still concerns me.

Another factor to consider is the salary system in my country. Here, some companies pay employees 14 salaries annuallyonce in the summer and once for Christmas. However, this depends on whether its included in the contract, and its not common for private sector jobs. Typically, collective agreements in industries like healthcare or manual labor mandate this system, but some private companies also adopt it to incentivize employees. I doubt this new company will implement such a system when they open their office, although it remains to be seen so I cannot totally rule it out.

Considering that its not easy to find a decent job that aligns with my interests in todays market, Im torn. Should I counter again for a higher base salary, or should I focus on the potential of the role and accept the offer as is? Any advice would be appreciated!","careerguidance",1,"https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1gzmjyq/would_you_go_for_a_job_that_pays_less_but_offers/","Embarrassed_Riser","2024-11-25",1732553888,1,1,0,0,"At my age, I consider TIME to be the most VALUABLE thing on this planet.

1. Customer Success Manager - especially in tech companies. you'd help customers get the most value from products/services. pays better than traditional customer service too
2. Technical Support Specialist - if you enjoy the problem-solving aspect. your warehouse experience could be valuable here since you understand physical products
3. Client Solutions Consultant - kinda like what youre doing now but more strategic. lots of companies need people who can actually understand customer needs and translate them into solutions
4. AI Customer Experience Specialist - this is pretty new but growing fast. you'd work with both customers and AI tools to provide better service. your natural empathy would be super valuable here since u actually care about helping people (unlike your current coworkers lol)

the best part about these roles is that they usually come with better pay and growth opportunities than traditional customer service. plus most companies are desperate for people who genuinely care about helping customers (seriously rare these days)","1"

1. the most successful professionals in their 50s are those who became ""tech-enabled experts"" - they combine their deep industry knowledge with modern tech/AI capabilities. its not about becoming a programmer, but rather knowing how to leverage new tools to increase their value
2. build a strong personal brand on linkedin. sounds cliche but seriously - older professionals who actively share their expertise/experiences tend to have more opportunities come their way. employers value thought leadership
3. focus on advisory/consulting roles where age + experience is actually an advantage. many companies need seasoned professionals who can guide strategic decisions
4. stay current with industry trends but dont try to compete with 20-somethings on execution tasks. instead position yourself as someone who can mentor/guide teams while providing strategic oversight

btw if ur interested in the tech/AI part, i can share some specific examples of how professionals are using AI to enhance their value. ive seen some really creative approaches that completely changed their career trajectory

the key is to start preparing WAY before hitting 50. most people wait until they're already feeling the pressure, which is too late","1"

instead of immediately jumping to surgery, have you considered exploring roles where your expertise matters more than physical appearance? there are tons of client-facing roles nowadays that are primarily remote/virtual, where your skills and communication abilities matter way more than looks.

also, if you want objective feedback about your appearance and potential improvements (both surgical and non-surgical), you might want to try using AI image analysis. i actually built jenova ai which has really good image analysis capabilities - you can upload photos and it gives detailed, objective feedback about facial features and potential improvements. its completely private and might give you better insights than random people online

for example, you can use AI to:

* learn bookkeeping concepts by having it explain things in simple terms
* get feedback on your social media posts
* create project management templates
* practice CRM scenarios
* analyze successful social media marketing campaigns

i actually built jenova ai partially because i wanted to help people learn skills faster. its pretty good at explaining complex topics in simple ways + you can ask followup questions until you really understand something

but regardless of what tools you use, i think your progression from VA  social media marketing  building an agency is solid. just make sure to document everything you learn along the way, itll be super valuable when your training your future team!

good luck with your journey! lmk if you need any specific advice about using AI for skill development","1"

"352","2024-11-25",1732549441,"Should I go into Technology Consulting or Software Development? ","Hi,

Im a senior majoring in IST (Information Sciences and Technology), and I recently received two offers:

Deloitte: GPS Business Technology Analyst.
PNC: Technology development program.

Heres my dilemma:

Im not sure what I want to do long-term, and Im also unsure if consulting is the right fit for me. Ive heard the work-life balance in consulting can be rough, and Im more introverted, which makes me wonder if Id feel drained by the fast-paced environment. I also always thought I wanted to go into a development role more than consulting and PNC would allow me to do that but I honestly dont know if development is what I actually want to do since I have no experience to know. 

PNCs rotational program appeals to me because it offers structured exploration and exposure to 4 different areas, which seems helpful since Im still figuring out my career path. One of the rotations is software development. 

Deloitte pays significantly more ($20K higher), has a prestigious name, and could open doors for me down the line. 

 Im worried that if i take the consulting role and hate it, switching to a development role will be harder down the road because as a IST major, I dont have a ton of technical experience and PNC would train me. 

Has anyone been in a similar situation? Which would you choose and why? Any advice on consulting vs. rotational programs would be super helpful!

\-is there any chance they are going to just use you for your local knowledge then dump you in a year once they have an established presence in the market. I am in the construction industry and this is way more common than it should be

\-is the increase actually as much as you think it is. your bonus being 1/3 of your pay as is and not having a bonus structure set in stone with the new place is an issue

\-are you prepared to walk away from a place you acknowledge has a good package, you are friends with your coworkers and enjoy working at. Maybe its worth having a discussion with your boss on how to move towards that 150k base pay

I have a dinner with the owners of the new company next week to discuss the future and Im really torn. This is a large increase in pay and having a newborn this could be a game changer. Anyone experienced this in the past? Any advice? Recommendations? Questions I should ask?

One of our biggest competitors just threw a job offer at me and I dont know what to do. 

Currently in a senior role with a commercial construction company on the East coast. I have a pretty good package here and the seniority to go with it. 120k base (paid weekly) + 50-75k annual bonus.

Disagree - but why bother making the comparison? You're not in competition.

You **have** a portfolio, a set of things which you've produced and achieved - it was created in a different field, so marketing it here will be a challenge. But you worked in marketing, so figure out a way to do that.

You can lament that youve wasted a decade of your life, or you can realize that at the end of the day, the days gonna end, and did you get any closer to where you want to be?

Im 35, and if there is one thing Ive learned in my life is that its NEVER too late to start over. Never. 

At 30 I was living in my mothers basement- careerless, depressed, and dangerously suicidal. Id gotten expelled from grad school twice, fired from my nonprofit job, and convinced I would die a loser and family disappointment. The only income I had was made by driving for Lyft and substitute teaching a few times a week. Fast forward 5 years and Ive gone to a 3-month UX bootcamp and gotten a job as a product designer at a major tech company making nearly $200k annually (started at $90k, got 2 promotions and multiple salary adjustments over 3 years at the company). I couldve given up- I wanted to, many times. But I knew that nothing I was doing was a waste because it was moving me *somewhere* away from where Id been the day before, and I believed in myself enough to know Id eventually see the destination and be glad I moved forward at all, even if it was an inch at a time. 

Start today. Do not think about other people. Focus on bettering yourself today over where you were yesterday. If you focus on only beating yourself you will literally never think of yourself as a failure. And you need to think of yourself this way if youre going to love yourself out of this miserable place youve admitted you are in. Reframing your perspective will be absolutely fundamental for your survival- please take it from someone whos been there and has clawed her way out.","1_1_1_1_2"

He still talks about wishing he'd have stayed at the journalism job, because ""the only things that sucked were the pay and the people."" His boss was a major dick and got others to treat him badly too.

Being 31 is quite young, you have a long life ahead of you and all the possibilities of changing careers. Things are not like they were in the 90s or early 2000s where you set out on one course of life and that was it. I believe research shows that people end up doing at least three different lines of work in their life time these days. 

That being said, I would be cautious of romanticizing other lines of work. Having worked with journalists for a number of years, the job is quite different than what it looks like from the outside. There is a difference between being interested in something and doing it as a job. If I were you, I would do reflect as to why you are feeling this way, perhaps the answer lies in changing certain aspects of your lifestyle rather than a sudden shift in careers. 

I wish you the best stranger.","4"

I also know how dark it gets when you think that you have no way out of it, but I tell myself At least I know marketing (i mean seo isnt that much of a deal when it comes to the whole grand picture of a solid marketing strategy but its better than nothing.

And I too want to get into something creative, like writing online novels. Its really hard to keep going when your day job is draining you.

Dont let anyone take that hope away&If you want to write and do something with it, keep going, try whatever you need to try. Research (you out of anyone else know best where to find the right places, guess seo research skill do come in handy), watch videos, read what others did, essentially find the places you wanna be in, get a site going& keep researching and get writing again.

In my space the average timeline to get a new role was 3 months, but some of my roles would take up to 9 months to fill. 

This is a difficult time to get a job in banking, as most banks will be on a hiring freeze until new budgets are released in march - once annual bonuses are paid. But some unofficial interviews will be starting already, so Id start networking with relevant hiring managers that will have future headcounts. Most official interviews (via HR) wont start until march, so thats likely your earliest start date, unless they are desperate for your skill set. 

As a first point of call, Id call up headhunters to see what is available in your space and how much activity there is (due-diligence is key, reputable firms only) whos expanding teams, who has headcounts but now and expected to in march. 

When I had candidates who had moved recently, many of the hiring managers were flexible to meet after hours / during lunch. Youll have to push back on headhunters for flexible interviews (not for senior staff like global heads, youd have to make yourself available, but if its got to that stage, youre in a good position to get the job regardless) 

It will be seen as a red flag for hiring managers leaving after 3 months. So youd want a good reason, but you should steer clear of insulting your current firm too much, aiming for a better firm should be your pitch, headhunter contacted you and you cant miss a once in a lifetime opportunity to work for a better firm etc but appreciate how it looks.. acknowledge it before they make assumptions.

Not sure whether this helps as you may be in a completely different space! 

Sorry to hear youre struggling in your new role, I had a string of horrendous firms this year and have taken time out (I have no co dependants, so it was an easier decision to make), working in finance is challenging and mentally draining, so please take care of yourself during the little free time you have.

First off, I just want to say you're not aloneso many people have been in a similar spot, and it's okay to feel conflicted about this.

Its great that you have 68 months of savings, so youve got some breathing room if you decide to take a step back. If your mental health is really suffering, it might be worth considering leaving and taking some time to find a role that actually fits you. The 3-month stint isnt ideal, but you can spin it in interviews as a learning experiencesomething like, It wasnt the right cultural fit, but it taught me a lot about what Im looking for in my next role.

If quitting feels too risky right now, maybe you could carve out some time to job search quietly. Even just sending out a couple of applications a week can give you options without completely burning yourself out.

Also, since you had good relationships at your last job, maybe reach out to some old colleagues or mentors. Who knows, they might know of opportunities or be willing to recommend you somewhere.

At the end of the day, your mental health matters. Its tough to carry the weight of being the main provider, but youll show up so much better for your family if youre in a role that doesnt drain you every day. Trust yourself to make the right calltheres no perfect solution, but youve got options. Hang in there!","3"

Im looking for some advice on a big decision. Im currently working as a backend developer, but over the past 1.6+ years, Ive been doing full-stack development, working on low-code platforms like Make and Glide, and even building websites on HubSpot CMS alongside full-stack projects. While Ive learned a lot, my company isnt paying well compared to market standards.

The Mauritian minimum wage is around MUR 16,000, and Im earning 16,000 + 3,000 for transport. This is significantly lower than what most developers earn here. I requested a raise, but the discussion led nowhere.

Now, Im planning to start university, and classes are starting this week. My company isnt supportive of my request to work part-time or take unpaid leave on class days. Im considering quitting to focus on my studies, but heres the issue:  
By my contract, Im required to serve a 2-month notice period, which overlaps with my classes. Im unsure how to manage this, and honestly, the job hasnt been paying well enough to justify staying. While university is free here, Im concerned about losing my income entirely.

Should I quit to prioritize university and figure out my finances later? Or should I try to stick it out for the notice period while starting my studies? Id really appreciate any advice or perspective.

The lengthy resignation letter is really a throwback to the 1950s (60s, 70s) where workers were expected to stay at one job for their entire career.

Appreciate the POV. :)

To those who simply expressed their judgment, I dont know how you thought your comments would help. But maybe your intention is not to help - maybe you just need to release bitterness in life. Hahaha. Sorry, cant help but feel that your answers are so bitter! I understand that Im privileged for thinking that I need time to recover before the next job, but its not my fault that you cant take a break. 

Maybe I didnt share enough details, but I just wanted to get straight to the point. Some more context for others to understand: 

1. My burnout has gotten bad to the point that I cannot sleep well, Ive lost weight, and Im constantly irritable. 
2. Quiet quitting is a good suggestion, but doing the bare minimum is not even possible with my bosses incredibly high standards. Everything I do is wrong and I get scolded for it. Ive tried ways to just fade into the background and avoid interaction / scolding, but its impossible with the projects Ive been assigned to. For me to just avoid the endless scolding, I cannot allow myself time to rest. 

Why Im asking how to break it to my manager:
Where I work, it doesnt work to just send an email stating whatever reason. Maybe its a difference in culture, but they will probe to no end.

In my last job, I stated that I was leaving for personal reasons. They werent satisfied and kept probing.  

I just want to be able to share a reason that they will 
1. accept without negotiation
2. believe and not doubt (because in my prev workplace, they started gossiping about my personal reasons) 

Thank you to those who addressed my actual concern and offered their answers. :)","9"

I would definitely resign after the holidays and ensure I give them the appropriate notice.

My preference would always be to have a job lined up, even if I was taking a break between jobs, especiallyin this market. You can negotiate your start date with most employers. So i would find my next job then give my notice and my start date would be notice plus break.

In regards to the second part, I would be honest but use a very professional tone and language. Instead of saying to toxic environment, you can say something like I don't fit in with some of my colleagues here as it seems certain individuals like calling out people and also seem to engage in office politics and this doesn't align with my way of working.

This way you're saying the same thing but you're not blaming everyone in the company and the wording is less direct and it makes it more likely to be received as constructive feedback rather than venting. Hopefully if they hear this from enough people it might encourage them to change and you'd have played dour part in that.

Anyway good luck with everything!","22"

Anyone with experience in the heritage sector will know that situation here isn't great, and short term contracts are the norm. Regardless it is what I love doing and I knew that'd be the case going into it.

I've been working for 18 months in a good job in a wealthy university, which I really love. My team are great, easily the best people I've worked with. The pay is also better than average for the sector. My contract is due up in 6 months, and though it has been extended once already, we are currently in a recruitment freeze, and there have been whispers of redundancies, although some of my colleagues say that this happens all the time and we shouldn't worry. They are good at internal recruitment, as a general rule.

The dilemma I have is this: after more than 5 rejections post interview due to lack of experience, I have finally been offered a role with the job title of Archivist, at a prominent institution. The contract however is only 3 months. The employer has said that they do all they can to keep people on, but that there is no guarantee of extension. I'd be one of about 6 people employed to undertake a specific project. There would be a salary increase of about £6000 a year, pre tax.

I really feel like I'm between a rock and a hard place here. I'm going to have to search for new jobs anyway before this one ends. But so far I have had no success getting offered this type of role. Turning it down feels like throwing away a real shot at the career I have been working at for years, but taking it feels like binning the additional 3 months of secure work in a role I really love with a team I really like.

Any advice very gratefully received.","careerguidance",2,"https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1h084bv/should_i_take_this_competitive_3_month_post_or/","SnooCupcakes780","2024-11-26",1732615021,1,1,0,0,"I would advice you to think about this long term. 

The fact is that in matter of months you are out of job anyway - likely, possibly. 

This 3 month role is the kind of role that will open you opportunities that you would not get without this 3 month role. 

What is your buffer financially speaking? Lets say you take the 3 month role, you downgrade absolutely everything you possibly can and live on as little money as possible. How much realistically can you save? These savings plus what you already have - how many months can you sustain yourself? 

In business and in life theres one rule: bigger the risk, bigger the reward. 

If I would have financial buffer for 3 months - that solves the problem doesnt it? Then you have either 6 months in your current job, 3 months in the new one plus 3 month financial buffer to support yourself. 

6 months and 6 months. 

If this is the case, I would not even think twice but then again, Im quite comfortable also taking risks. 

The 3 month job will not be for nothing regardless. You will learn what you wont learn in your current one. Think of it as your intellectual asset. You can ALWAYS benefit from intellectual asset.","1"

1. Costs: Its super expensive, and Im wondering if I could stay back and return it.

Do average people get interships, partimes and on campus jobs.

Is it feasible to have good work/life balance early in your career?","Hello, I am currently a senior in high school going to University next year. I've found that I'm very interested in law because of concepts associated with it (high reading comprehension, critical thinking, writing, legal &amp; logical issues, research, etc.) and know that I can succeed in these skills. I also have had long conversations with relatives and parents of friends that have held long careers in law, and feel pretty confident that I have a similar interest as them in law. 

However, I'm aware that people with my desires for a career in law, which are a good-work life balance with low client interaction and a decent wage, are always told that this kind of work is not what law offers. I completely understand and expect this from more well-known careers such as in big law, but from my online research it seems that there are a good amount of job titles that can offer regular working hours, such as:

\- Government Attorney

\- Estate Planning Attorney

\- In-House Consultant

\- Patent Attorney

Or others that I haven't fully discovered. I'd guess is that it couldn't be that easy to land these jobs at a good salary, otherwise they would be mentioned alongside the usual 80 hour week jobs a lot more. My question is, how feasible is it to be able to get a \~40 hour work week (or low stress in general) job a few years after law school without having to settle for a very low salary? 

Also, I often hear that people often go to BL/large law firms in their first few years, and then switch to in-house for better balance, which I am totally willing to do but I would simply like to know my options.

I could really use some advice or insight on my career journey. Heres my situation:

I have a bachelors degree in industrial engineering and have been in the industry for almost three years. However, Ive had a rocky startIve been fired twice. Technically, both times I was put on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) and chose to quit instead because, lets be honest, PIPs are often just a formality before youre let go.

First job: I was there for 1.5 years. Toward the end, I wasnt happy, and I know my performance slipped. I got put on a PIP, but the thing is, just a month before, my performance review wasnt anything like the PIP. I quit before the PIP could play out, and later I found out they eliminated my role entirely.

Second job: I was there for 5 months. I regularly asked my boss for feedback and usually got positive responses, with minor critiques like focus a bit more on this project. Two weeks before the PIP meeting, I asked again and was told things were fine. ThenboomIm on a PIP, and its completely different from what Id been told before.

Now, Im feeling like industrial engineering might not be for me. The idea of staying in the field feels overwhelming and discouraging. Im thinking about going back to school for a masters in accounting, but I keep wondering:
	""	Is it too late to turn my career around? Im in my late 20s and feeling behind.
	""	Is switching to accounting a good idea? Will I be able to have a successful career if I make the jump?

If anyone has gone through something similarwhether switching fields, dealing with job setbacks, or finding success after a rough startId love to hear your story. Im trying to stay optimistic but also want to be realistic about my options.

I am currently working for the government and have been doing so for the past six months. However, during the application process, I made a mistake that I deeply regret. I misrepresented my employment history by claiming that I worked at a previous job for 34 months, when in reality, I was only there for 12 weeks.

I, 18F, am not sure if what I'm doing is right, or if I can really survive knowing that even though I'm still in my 1st year, I can't seem to like my course (Accountancy).

Just for some context, I am the eldest daughter of two younger brothers. My mother is a single mom. I'm expected to be the breadwinner of my family and put my brothers through school. My relatives have high expectations, and expect me to become a professional due to my academic record. I live in the Philippines and I am a Filipino.

It all started when my aunt took me in to support my studies. Since my family wasn't doing well financially. She asked me what I wanted to do, and at the time, I didn't really have an idea. I was a creative person who liked to make stories and would've loved to do animation if I could. So, instead I said, ""Psychology. I want to be a psychologist."" Mainly because there was a part of me who wanted to help people through their trauma, because I've went through my fair share too and wanted to help. But my aunt told me it wasn't a lucrative job here in the Philippines. So she made me choose: Architecture or Accountancy? I liked to draw but hated physics, so I took up accountancy. 

During my senior high school years I actually liked accounting, even when I had a hard time at first. But now that I'm in college and I'm studying more about it (standards, conceptual frameworks, partnership, corporation, really basic stuff ik), I'm just so drained. I've never felt such a strong aversion and hatred for anything. I started questioning myself if I was even smart in the first place (I knew I wasn't, but I was an academic achiever, so it still hurts), or whether I could even survive studying 3 more years about this. I'm just memorizing at this point without actually understanding anything. In addition, I seem to be extremely weak in my analysis skills in comparison to my peers who seem to be doing okay (are struggling, but okay nonetheless).  I just don't have the passion for it, and it wasn't my ""choice"". I'm just wondering if this is alarming since it's so early on (3 months into my first semester), and if I should consider shifting into a different course. 

Although, even then, I'm still confused as to what course I'd even take. I fear that because I chose the ABM strand I may need to exert even more effort if I were to shift completely outside of business (for the record, I was never business oriented). 

I really don't know what to do. I only know that I don't like it here, it's taking up all my energy, my mental health is not doing great, and that I get frustrated and angry even as I try to study. I'm wondering if I'm just overthinking this and if I should just give this first year a chance.

I am facing a dilemma. 

I had an offer from Company A and they wanted me to start ASAP so I did. I had also just interviewed with Company B(big tech) but they needed more time to interview other candidates. 

By this point, I had already put in my notice with my old job, so I had to start with Company A. 

After starting with A, I followed up with B for their decision and informed them I have until the end of the month to make a choice between the two. At this point B doesnt know I have started with A. This is because they had indicated that upon knowing I started with A, they would likely pull my name out of consideration so as to not waste the recruiter's time. To this note, they had explicitly requested me to be transparent about accepting the other offer. I held back telling them because I still wanted a shot at B.

If I get offered the job at B, I would regret leaving company A after only a short week or two but Company B has a better offer and prospect, so I would probably switch.

Here's what I am worried about if I do get offered a job from B -

1. How much of a problem will B have with my lack of transparency?
2. How do I bring this up/approach it with the hiring manager when I will be offered the job?
3. Since this will show up in my background check, could B rescind my offer since I would have recently jumped ship from A, and they doubt my trustworthiness?
4. What should be my general course of action?

Trying to put my nose to the grindstone and figure my life out. Plus side is in the past year, I've graduated with a associate's in computer systems and network technology, got a helpdesk position at my dream company, and bought a car, and have 0 debt, and have few responsibilities so not much is holding me back. Even did a bit of volunteer EMS to see if I enjoy the medical field and I loved it! Downside is I'm 28 and I feel like I'm running out of time, live with my parents, and questioning my career path to network engineering and considering switching fields to paramedic or nursing.

Thing is I can't decide and my head hurts from stressing too much. I've mapped out in my head hopefully multiple paths to success, but I need advice because I'm what you'd probably call in a state of analysis paralysis. I have already decided to go back to get a bachelor. The only question is which one? Either I stick with my career field with the goal of Network Engineering (which I do semi-enjoy still) or do I switch to paramedic/nursing related field which I have more initial interest in atm?

\-------------------------------------

\-(4 Years)My first option is the safer path which is get a bachelors in Comp Sci or Comp Engy to strengthen my computer networking career. A bachelor's always looks good on resumes and I don't doubt this would help me with more advanced knowledge and a great look resume. Additionally, this would work well in my 30s in accelerated programs if I ever did decide to switch careers later. I'd probably just volunteer as EMS to scratch that itch on the side.

\-(3-5 Years) My second option is a bit riskier and involves a career switch, which is going straight for an associates of nursing degree which is a 2 year program for ADN which I can later complete the bachelor's once I'm actually working in the field. I haven't shadowed anyone in a hospital yet, so I'd need to do that to decide. I hear once you have a couple years' experience as a nurse, your never out of a job which is a big plus to me. Plus, I'm sure my technical background will help in more technical roles in nursing field.

(6 Years) My third option is the longest and that's doing a major in Comp Sci or Comp Engy and a minor in either paramedic or nursing. Downside is I worry if I focus on both careers that I won't be good at either of them, and I want to complete my college sometime in my early 30's

"556","2024-11-26",1732593276,"How to navigate supervisor drama?","Hi all, I'm in quite a conundrum atm, and I would sincerely appreciate any available advices.

Context: I'm currently working at an arguably elite resort, and recently there has been a full-blown drama between 2 of my supervisor, let's call them A and B. 
Supervisor A is a Chief Manager (he is second in command only to the Head of Dep). This person is in a very dubious relationship with Supervisor C, which everyone in the workplace knows about. Imagine going to work seeing them acting full lovebirds as if in a 2000s romcom movie. This escalates to the point that there might be days when all the employess work their asses off to serve hundreds of guests, while they just stand around, wipe plates and chat. The kitchen knows this, the receptionists team knows this, the F&amp;B team, including me, knows this. This started 2 months ago. Normally, these 2 lovebirds love placing me on the day they are working together, since I always keep my head down and dont ever talk or look at what they are doing. Basically, I act dumb, literally and figuratively. And I have come to be probably the person who knows most of their actions, after the CCTV team in the reception who has all the cameras. Needless to say, Sup A does not do shit in his shift, always has zero things done and leaves everything to F&amp;B team. Me and my coworker once got sexually harassed by a customer and he did not care to ask about our wellbeing or report the incident, while other managers took great care of that situation. Bro is chill beyond measures.

Supervisor B is a strict person with standards, but is not without reason. She is the polar opposite of Sup A, which started this drama. 

A few days ago Sup B came to work and saw that nothing had been finished, and so she told me to do task 1. I just returned from break. However, Sup A wanted me to finish task 2. I told them to reach a consensus and that I could only do 1 thing at a time. Sup B yielded to Sup A, and I did what Sup A said. After a couple of minutes, Sup B told me to do task 1, I went to do task 1, Sup A saw that and told me to do task 2, I followed the command, and Sup B told me to focus on task 1. Sup A got mad, swore, and Sup B yielded to him again. She left soon afterwards. Sup A apologized to me, said he was disrespected and that there should be a chain of commands, implying he is the Chief Manager while she is only a Manager.
When I was doing task 3, Sup B came back. I knew she just stopped crying. She was checking her phone. I knew she just reported the situation. Important point, when Sup B got insulted by Sup A, I was the only witness.
The day after that I had a shift with Sup B. In short, she vented 30 min to me about the situation. I listened. After work, she continued to vent to me another 30 min on the way home, telling me to step up and help her. I did not want to get involved. Then she told me that Sup A and Sup C badmouthed me in the meetings of the manager, and she had always been defending me. According to her, they badmouthed everyone, except for themselves. I dont know how much that could affect me. She told me Sup A called her a b, and that Sup A told her I was stupid for wiping a table with a dry cloth (perhaps I was absent minded a bit, sincere apology). Also, the CCTV team has the clip of Sup A and Sup C doing something that according to Sup B, ""they replayed that clip over and over again"". All in all, she told me if I didnt step up and call HR to report them with her, things would get to me next. I dont know what to think. She said she had already reported them, and it was my call next. She messaged me when I got home to hammer the point again. 
The story ends here.

Question: What should I do now?

I would love to hear some advice from you all. I have always tried my best to never get involved. I just want to go to work, get paid and have my life. I cannot afford to lose this job. So I dont even know what to do know, now that the situation has escalated to this point. I have also told Sup B that I would try to do my best to help her, but I am scared, and that I would have to think about my wording carefully. Again, my top priority is to keep the job, and stay away fro  the blast radius of whatever is to come.

Perhaps I got caught up in this mess because Im too neutral, and I acted dumb all the time, so it might be the case that Sup B thinks Im an easy recruit. But regardless, Im caught up in a stalemate.

Thank you so much for reading my situation, and please if possible, I would love to hear from you all.","careerguidance",0,"https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1h02u73/how_to_navigate_supervisor_drama/",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

i started university as a biochemistry major because i was in a biomed program in high school, and at the time i thought i wanted to pursue medical school (in hindsight, i only wanted that because my best friend planned on it, and i just followed suit) and so i thought that was the best major to get me there. but after taking my major classes, i've realized that a. i'm terrible at chemistry, and b. although i like stem subjects, it isn't what i want to spend the rest of my life doing. 

i've always loved to draw and design, and so i used to want to pursue some form of graphic arts degree. but i know that finding work in that field is incredibly hard and unstable. at the end of the day, i just want to get some stable job so that i can support my family. they have given up so much for me to even get to university, and i'm afraid i'm disappointing them by not having my mind made up about a career now.

if anything, i'm just more interested in humanities degrees--psychology, philosophy, etc. i've always enjoyed and performed better in those classes throughout high school. all the clubs i was in (model un, ethics &amp; debate, rho kappa, etc) revolved around those subjects. but it seems like almost everyone is pursuing some form of stem degree because that is what the market wants right now, so i feel like i should be doing the same as my peers.

i've been looking at changing my major, but with so many options out there, i just feel overwhelmed. i was thinking of doing some kind of international business degree (i love experiencing other cultures and traveling, and i think i'm somewhat of a culturally aware person) or maybe a marketing degree, and then pursuing minors in graphic arts/psychology/biology. honestly, as much hate as office/corporate jobs get, i feel like the stability/routine it brings is what attracts me to it. i also think my personality is better suited for those roles.

i know i just started university and there's always the possibility of changing majors later on, but i just feel this immense pressure as i finished all my gen. eds during high school through ap exams, so my advisors want me to start taking major specific classes that don't transfer.

I got laid off in June from the company I'd been at almost 3 years - they gave me 3 months left to work and I was able to find a new job and leave on my own accord before my last day in August.

I get to this new company and should've known I was doomed from the start. They put me on a brand that was a shit show and impossible to manage, my coworkers are telling me that there's been layoffs, they were told no bonuses or raises, the company is in choppy waters etc. 

I got put on a PIP out of nowhere at only 2 months in and despite doing everything they asked I was let go. HR spewed some crap about how it has nothing to do with me, I'm a talented worker, I tried harder than they'd ever seen anyone try on a PIP, etc etc - they even gave me severance. So it honestly feels more of a layoff and they put me on the PIP to save their ass because they were gonna LIFO me. 

My question is: how fucked am I? I feel they totally screwed me over bc how do I explain just under 4 months there? Am I better off leaving it off my resume and just having my last job that I left in Aug 2024 and lie about the gap in my resume?

In the afternoon today I get an email from my boss to come speak to them at the end of the day.

So tomorrow morning Ill have a meeting with my boss and HR to see what they have to say. My guy feeling is that they will give me the extension but not exactly sure for how long.

"586","2024-11-26",1732579428,"Is it time for my wife to leave her job that's severely impacting her mental health, even without another opportunity lined up?","My wife has been working in FP&amp;A at the same company for over a decade; it was her first job out of college. For the past couple of years, shes been in a role she absolutely hates, taking on an increasing workload in a severely understaffed team. Despite her efforts to discuss moving to another team with her managers, nothing has come of it since theres no one to take over her responsibilities.

This high-stress environment has significantly impacted her mental health over the last two years. Shes sought help through therapy and a psychiatrist and was diagnosed with depression and severe anxiety disorder. Although shes taken time off work, the same issues resurface when she returns, with tasks often waiting for her.

At this point, shes completely drainedemotionally and physicallyand struggles to do much of anything outside of work. Given the circumstances, would it be reasonable for her to quit her job without another lined up, take some time to decompress, and focus on her health before returning to the workforce? Would the gap on her resume be a significant roadblock? Her long-term goal is to remain in the same field, but shes finding it increasingly difficult to keep going in her current situation.

From a financial perspective, my income should cover most, if not all, of our expenses and health insurance, though wed need to cut back on savings and discretionary spending

Update:  Thank you all for the feedback; weve had some discussions since. In terms of information, we were mainly trying to understand how significant this career break might be for her and to hear from others whove been in similar situations. Her job wasnt so bad prior to Covid and she saw decent growth that almost tripled her salary within the same company. Just the recent couple of years has been incredibly difficult with no end in sight. Her long-term goal is to continue working, and her reasoning is that its better or at least easier to take this step now at 35 rather than later in her 40s. For now, shes going to take in the information and take sometime to decide. 

The loss of income is understandably intimidating, and the idea of unemployment feels quite daunting. However, on paper it appears that were doing ok. My income can cover most expenses and there are enough liquid savings to cover most emergencies. Saving rate would definitely take a hit and some discretionary items would need to be reduced. 

As for taking FMLA first, thats a very personal decision for her. Shes already decided not to return to work after the 12 weeks unpaid , so whether she quits now or after FMLA doesnt make much difference. At this point, theres some resentment toward the company, and she feels its better to move on sooner rather than later. We will probably have more discussions on this. 

Lastly, regarding quiet quitting, thats something her personality just wont allow. We believe this stems from her upbringing in a traditional Asian household, where working hard, pleasing others and giving 100% was deeply reinforced. In her case, its probably more severe and Its an issue shes aware of and needs to work on, but probably not in this job.

"607","2024-11-26",1732656901,"How can I choose between career growth and personal goals when my promotion is imminent? What questions should I ask myself?","I am at my first job out of school and now find myself at a crossroads. I enjoy the work I do for the most part; though it is a high stress job, the company has our backs over our clients, has a welcoming and supportive culture, and has taught me a lot in the last year and a half working here. My managers all have glowing reviews for me and say they are planning to promote me next cycle. That said, we are in a small industry and there are limited growth opportunities salary and position-wise after this next promotion, so while Ive hit my groove and enjoyed a lot of success here lately, I never planned on staying more than 3 years.

Now, my partners contract is ending and he wants us to move back to Philadelphia. This makes sense from a personal life and financial perspective; all our friends are there, we love the food scene and location (yes, even with the crime), and what I currently pay to share my 3b1b apartment with strangers is what our friends pay in total for their entire apartment. 

That said, if I start looking for a new job now, I wont get my promotion, as they only ever happen on April 1st. I poured a lot of time, energy, and dedication into several projects in the last 6 months and gained a lot of recognition in different departments for my work. I also love several of my clients and they frequently tell me Ive been helpful and easy to work with. So, while the role itself is high stress and probably not for me long term, I dont want to throw away months of tears and labor and give up on having that promotion on my resume.

But, if I stay here even for a few more months, I risk being absolutely miserable in my personal life. I sacrificed a lot of hobbies and time with friends, my partner, and my family by staying here, and finding a new job in a city I love sounds like the perfect opportunity to get my life back. My partner is also almost certainly looking for Philly positions and will move away with or without me since thatll be my goal eventually, but weve done long distance before and I felt absolutely miserable (not because of him, just the situation).

Do I give up on the prize Ive been slaving away for over the last 6 months? This likely means starting over at entry level since this is a niche industry, and I only have 1.5 years of experience. So this also could mean giving up my salary as well.

TL;DR:
I can either stick out months of misery to get promoted for all of my hard work, making a job hop easier/potentially more lucrative than starting over at entry level, or I can be happy personally and save $$ on rent.

"614","2024-11-26",1732655538,"Took a little break, looking for work again, where to start?","Hi all,

I'm a 29(M), that was laid off from a political advocacy remote job in May 2023 (org ran out of money and my team was cut). I decided to take a little break, I could afford to with savings, low amount of expenses, and a side gig that I got some income from. Nothing close to a normal salary, but enough to keep my savings from bleeding out. I chose to put my time and energy into said side gig (teaching and coaching martial arts), and it honestly has been some of the most fulfilling work that I've done. 

However, it has come to the point where I realize I probably need a day job again. My savings are fine, honestly it grew because I just finished up a quick contract job. But I hope in the future to open my own gym, I want to help my parents get a new place, and I want to spend some of the money I have to live life a little bit. So, I've come to the realization that I need a day job again. 

Problem is, is that I don't really know where to start. I cleaned up my resume, but I don't really want to go back to the work I was previously doing. It was very political, and within that it was very niche position. There is also a severe lack of said political positions at the moment after a major election and I am pretty burned out on political work. I'm pretty anxious that my political work experience will make me less appealing for employers but more than that I just don't know what I want to do. The obvious thing is I would love to keep doing what I'm doing now, teaching and coaching martial arts but that just won't pay enough. 

I've also found it very difficult to care about the companies I'm looking at, what they're doing, what they're selling etc. Political work was easy in that I kind of knew what I was working for, but in my job search it's been difficult to kind of care. I know at the end of the day, it's just a job and I should treat it as a means to achieve the things I want, but it definitely is a bit of a demotivator.

So, is there any advice or guidance that people may be able to offer me? I'm in no dire situation in my head, but I do feel a little stuck. I don't have any particular technical/hard skills, most of my previous job experiences has given me a good deal of soft skills though. Me currently teaching and coaching martial arts has given me a great amount of experience and soft skills as well. If anyone has questions, feel free to ask. I realize some of the information provided is vague, but I just want to keep things kind of anonymous for my own privacy's sake.

"615","2024-11-26",1732655230,"How do people get real information on career outlooks that isn't just some mentally unwell people venting on Reddit?","Hopefully you know what I'm on about. The shitshow that is r/accounting screeching about globalization all day being a good example.  

You would think that in the age of the internet, getting a genuine idea of what someone actually does day to day (rather than a romanticized version of it, I made that mistake with software development), a healthy and objective idea of it's outlook over a significant period of time, would be fairly easy. If it is, I'm clearly not looking hard enough because Google is not your friend here. You'll get:  

\- Aforementioned Reddit rants 

\- Slightly less than slop articles form national news agencies like Forbes and MSNBC with extremely short pieces meant to fill headlines, also often very doom &amp; gloom (healthcare bleeding workers! No one wants to work for greedy horrible hospitals any more! etc.)

\- Actual slop, often clearly written by an AI  

\- Talking heads on YT, many of whom do private coaching involving their specific field (this seems like one of the slightly better sources of info out there but often still feels a bit slimy and untrustworthy)

Everything is either portrayed exclusively in negative terms, or was written by either a ""grindset bro"" or a school looking for your money. Flexible career paths that don't give you specific skills anyone's looking for VS. over-specialized career paths that lock people into something cruddy for the rest of their lives. Fields getting outsourced or automated or destroying your body with little compensation for it, doom and doom and doom. 

In practice, it seems as though people sort of just *toss themselves* in a direction with little to no thought behind it. I see people talking about how they didn't realize that their education wasn't necessary, or that they need extra schooling they were unaware of, etc., lots of ""Oh we'll help you find a career that you love!"" nonsense out there that doesn't tell you anything you weren't already aware of (often from throwaway government websites). 

Do we really just expect people to dedicate a few years of their life and god knows how much money to step head-first into career paths that might not suit them at all and might be total dead ends?

Ive spent 5 years in B2B software sales and now spent 5 years bartending. Although Ive enjoyed bartending I feel its time to maybe move away from the service industry as a whole as my main options for future success require either pursuing fine dining service or running some kind of catering/bar service company for events. Things I have been considering. 

I did software sales in my early 20s, and honestly did amazing, but the stress and pressure did a dent on my mental health. Ive considered getting back into that line of work, being older and more mature and wiser now, but not sure if itll just be the same as before or if being older now might actually help. 

So Im focusing on certain certifications I could look into which could change my career path. Even if it means starting over at something making less than I do currently, because if its 9-5 or similar weekday work, I could easily still supplement with a bar shift on Friday and Saturday and not see a massive drop in my income. 

Some things I have considered: getting a claims adjuster license and getting into claims adjusting, or networking/security certifications and launching into a more IT focused realm. Saleforce certification could be interesting and tie in my experience in sales and software, as well as setting up software on behalf of my prior bosses and friends. 

I want to stay away from anything like B2C sales, so financial advising certifications are not a bit priority or thought. 

Also something Ive considered is not standard jobs, as Ive done a great job of keeping my body healthy and no major physical limitations, so things like working as a merchant marine or off-shore work.

Ive been preparing to apply for the 4+1 accelerated masters program at my university (application due in about a month and a half). Ive already asked for recommendation letters and was set on the idea that it could serve as a strong ""supporter"" for applying to Ph.D. programs down the line. However, based on conversations Ive had with professionals and peers, it seems that even with the 4+1, Id still need to put in significant work afterward to make a competitive Ph.D. application.

The issue is, I wasnt the best student earlier on(I currently have a 2.8 GPA)and I only started to have a clearer vision of my future later in college. I dont want to be judged, but a lot of difficult, uncontrollable things happened that impacted my motivation. Now Im trying to make up for lost time.

Recently, a professional I spoke with suggested that instead of the accelerated program, I focus on more school at the undergrad level. They recommended extending my time to complete two minors (one in life sciences, the other in business), improving my GPA, and gaining more experience. This route could also give me the chance to complete at least two more internships, which would help me better prepare for Ph.D. applications or future jobs. Financial aid would cover this extension. Heres where Im stuck:

* Would the extra time and effort of improving my GPA, completing minors, and doing more internships be a better route to prepare for a Ph.D. and my career?
* Or should I stick with the 4+1 program, since its a more structured and clear step forward, even if it still means Ill need to do a lot of work afterward?

I know this all comes down to my long-term goals, but Im trying to figure out the best use of my time and energy right now. If youve been in a similar position or have advice about whether to focus on GPA and experience versus going straight into the 4+1 program, Id love to hear your thoughts.

2. Economists arent really respected by the general public (if you tell someone youre studying economics, theyll just think youre into money or politics, and wont even realize youre doing something math-related).

So, is it really worth it to keep going with economics? Would it make more sense to switch to something like Electrical/Computer Engineering (Im into engineering too, so Id probably enjoy it just as much as econ and could probably finish in 4 years)? Im not sure if theres another option Im missing, but Im kinda desperate and feel like I need a clear path that will help with both earning potential and respect.

P.S. Im from Spain, but Id probably want to migrate.

The pay at my current job is okay. It's 50k, which is just enough for me to pay my half of bills and buy groceries. My husband is currently making about 90k/year. I would have to borrow from him with this job occasionally, for any unexpected expenses like car repair etc. and I'm not able to save anything. The work is also stressful and I find the company to be wildly disorganized - a lot of extra work is falling on me rather than being distributed properly amongst the team. 

Those cons aside, one huge benefit is they're very flexible with working arrangements. As my son started daycare two months ago, he's been ill basically this whole time, and I've had to wfh and take time off to be home with him as my husband works out of town and we have no family nearby for childcare. They seem to have no issues with a new hire having to take a lot of time off. I've probably wfh about 8 days of my 2 month employment here, and had to fully take about 4 days off to care for my son. 

Now ive got an offer of a job in the same field for 75k/year. This job also offers a 10% yearly bonus. This increase would allow me to contribute to our savings and have extra for unexpected expenses. The issue is, they're adamantly not a wfh environment and i didn't get the impression in the interview that it would be a particular enjoyable place to work.

Is it more valuable to have the ability to wfh and take time off? For me, the answer seems too be the pay increase is worth it, but I wanted to get done outside opinions as well.

Both jobs are in my field and for essentially the same role. The 50k I make at my current role is low for the industry, but I accepted it as something is better than nothing.","careerguidance",4,"https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1h0l0vc/should_i_leave_this_job_or_stay_for_the/",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I am facing a dilemma. 

I had an offer from Company A and they wanted me to start ASAP so I did. I had also just interviewed with Company B(big tech) but they needed more time to interview other candidates. 

By this point, I had already put in my notice with my old job, so I had to start with Company A. 

After starting with A, I followed up with B for their decision and informed them I have until the end of the month to make a choice between the two. At this point B doesnt know I have started with A. This is because they had indicated that upon knowing I started with A, they would likely pull my name out of consideration so as to not waste the recruiter's time. To this note, they had explicitly requested me to be transparent about accepting the other offer. I held back telling them because I still wanted a shot at B.

If I get offered the job at B, I would regret leaving company A after only a short week or two but Company B has a better offer and prospect, so I would probably switch.

Here's what I am worried about if I do get offered a job from B -

1. How much of a problem will B have with my lack of transparency?
2. How do I bring this up/approach it with the hiring manager when I will be offered the job?
3. Since this will show up in my background check, could B rescind my offer since I would have recently jumped ship from A, and they doubt my trustworthiness?
4. What should be my general course of action?

My parents used to get called into school a lot to discuss her grades. During 7th grade, the school referred her to a counsellor and after some evaluation they thought it would be best if she went to a special school. For high school she went to a special school and she graduated and has since completed a 2 year course at a local culinary school.

She has since expressed to me how unpleasant and abusive primary school was for her. It took her a bit of time to understand some things and when she would ask for help from the teachers they would get so upset and would even beat her and insult her. Mind you we went to a public South African school where corporal punishment is normalised and a lot of these teachers do not have patience and dont understand that some learners just need a bit more patience and time to understand, and these kinds of teachers are truly some of the worst people youll ever meet. And it also really does not help when youre struggling and when you ask for help you get a beating.  She also told me about a time where she was struggling to write some letters, mind you she was around 5 years old and when she asked for help, the teacher pointed to her and said to the other kids if you dont go to school, youll end up like her. Occurrences like that instilled a fear of school in her. 

At the culinary school there were few learners so the lecturers had time to help each student individually. This lead to her doing so well to the point where she became top of her class.

I thought it would eventually lead to gaining experience into what I wanted to do (CRM administrator). In some ways it did give me a little bit of experience and on a user/superuser level.

I decided to take it so I can grow and learn but now I'm still thinking about analytics. I do feel like both could compliment each other in some way.

I rated in top 5 best people on my position based on score (out of 60+) and was put into a team with very demanding clients to ensure good cooperation.

I tried multiple times to apply for higher position or a raise, however at my company, unless you have some kind of friends among the bosses, there are only ""inflation"" raises of about 2-3% a year, so after working for 2+ years, my salary only went up of about 72$.

Some of my coworkers, who worked about as long as me, are already on their 2nd promotion, and I am being completely shunned away, while performing really well at my position.

I also really don't want to go into such conspiracy theories, because 90% of the time when people do that it's just cope, but at my corpo majority of people getting promoted and people who are put into manager positions, are women. Only about 20% of project managers and leadership positions are ran by men. The entire HR and people doing the recruitment process are also women.

Education: Im majoring in Management Information Systems (MIS). Ill admit I didnt dive deeply into all the technical aspects during my coursework, so Im still building confidence in areas like coding and advanced analytics. However, Im actively learning and improving.

Work Experience:
Digital Transformation Intern: Created blog content, analyzed engagement metrics, and streamlined workflows. Used tools like Excel and Python to enhance project timelines and deliverables.

Marketing and Partnerships Intern: Analyzed customer behavior to improve engagement by 33.8% and contributed to strategies that achieved a 37% KPI improvement. Created presentations for business strategy meetings and tracked ROI metrics.

NielsenIQ Scholar Program: Collaborated in a team of 9 to analyze sales data, market share, and competitor trends for a global CPG company. Presented insights and actionable recommendations to industry professionals using Excel.

Volunteer Data Analyst: Processed Slack data in JSON format, converted it to structured datasets using Python and Excel, and worked with team members to compile actionable reports.
Class Projects: Analyzed a 15,000+ record dataset, created Power BI dashboards, and explored data trends to identify sampling bias and feature distributions.

Skills: Beginner-level Python, Excel, and Power BI. My technical skills are basic, but Im committed to improving through hands-on experience and troubleshooting.

I was ready to step into his position because I had always been the one training new employees, and while my manager was absent, I acted as the team supervisor.

However, the day after the boss fired him, she announced that the new manager would be another employeesomeone who had shown no interest in advancing his career and hadnt contributed nearly as much as I had while the manager was away.

A year later, that same person was demoted back to his previous position, while I was promoted to a higher role. The new manager came from a different team altogether. To my surprise, I found out that the demoted employee was still earning the same salary he had as a manager, while Idespite my higher position and increased responsibilitieswas earning much less.

At a corporate party, this former manager told me he was chosen for the role because our previous manager assumed I had snitched on him, so he selected someone else out of spite.

Despite all this, I continued to work hard. I trained new employees, proposed new features for our admin systems to make work faster and easier, and actively contributed to the team's success. Yet, at the end of the year, that same employee received a 5% raise, while I only got 4%, even though I had done significantly more work.

When I expressed my frustration to the manager, she told me I wasnt ""active enough."" This was particularly upsetting because even my colleagues acknowledged that I was the most active and helpful person on the team. Whenever they faced issues, they came to me for help, not to the new manager or even the previous one.

I think this new position would broaden my skill set, get me out of engineering, and give me an entrance to the software field while also keeping me in the same realm of engineering. 

I am just worried doing software support/user success will put me in a weird spot when it comes to career progression. However, the company is very laid back and claims to let people switch internally to roles that better suit themselves (consulting, R&amp;D, etc.) I dont want to regret turning down this job offer especially in this tight of a job market.

And who takes the initiative? Should I take the initiative or wait until for my co-workers start to follow me?

I recently got a new job (I work there now for about six months). I noticed that many co-workers from my department follow each other on Instagram. I am active on Instagram (private account), post regularly and try to make interesting content of my travels. I noticed that many of my co-workers (like the ones I have lunch with) also have a private account.

Based on the fact that they all follow each other, I think it would be all right if I would just follow a few, the ones I interact with most. But at the same time I'm someone who's socially very insecure and easily afraid of what others think of me, what makes me hesitant to take the initiative. Also, the atmosphere is nice between co-workers in my department and we have lunch together daily where we chitchat about our weekends and such.

What are your experiences with following co-workers on Instagram? And does anyone have advice for me how to best approach this?

P.S. I tried to bring up Instagram in a subtle manner, by mentioning that I'm on Instagram or that I also saw something on Instagram, so that my colleagues know I'm an active user.

I am the only one who does my role specifically, but there is an adjacent team of two people who have some overlap with my role but they do a lot of other things.

So for simplicity's sake, let's say I am the only person on Team 1 and there are two people on Team 2.   
  
Initially, my manager got approved for one more hire on Team 1 and one more hire on Team 2. This was great news because I felt too scared to ask for PTO or a mental health day because I am the only one who did my role. Team 2 feels overwhelmed, and they are also excited about a new person joining their team.  
  
Now, recently, there has been talk of me moving over to team 2, eliminating team 1, and then only needing to hire one more person. So, 4 people on one team instead of 5 people on two teams. This was actually pretty acceptable in my opinion because I don't feel overwhelmed (I feel like I have a healthy workload most days and the other team feels a little stressed).

In my most recent team meeting with my skip-level however, they said they are going to move me and NOT hire a new person and just see how it goes with three people. ""This will save us a ton of EBITA, etc.""

Again, I can justify going from 2 to 1 after melding the teams, but going 2 to 0 feels off. My skip-level says we can save more money by not hiring anyone and we can wait until we are in a bad spot to hire someone. I don't love that they justified the workload for two hires enough to get budget for it, but instead are going to push that onto the existing people with no extra pay. Keep in mind, when we don't have our normal duties, we are already in charge of writing out all our SOPs and templates (which in my opinion should fall under the manager, but I don't really mind doing it).

Context: Money is not really an issue for my company because we have been doing well and we also just got over 300 million dollars in funding.

I want to write to them suggesting that they give the existing team an increase in base pay since we are going be saving them 1-2 extra hires. None of us make that much, and our managers make 40k+ more than us, and our skip-level makes even more than that. Am I being unreasonable/entitled to ask for a base pay raise?

The catch is that I have to stay one year after my degree is finished. Being a master's in chemistry feels like it would like a long time + the extra year with my employer. We do not give large promotions or bonuses here. I feel like this is a major point in my life (I am single atm) and I want to make the right choice of whether to stay here and rough it out or try to get into a new industry possibly.

My first idea was to buy a home, get my master's, and see if I could get another position elsewhere and sell the home and make a small profit instead of renting. I have a dog and she is my only responsibility. I have been engaged and also in a one year relationship after that. Those did not work out and I also just need to keep myself busy, I have no issues with matching with women but lately I just feel like I might be wasting my time or taking way too long to find someone. At this age I don't want to be an old dad. Thanks for any feedback. I am getting back into therapy after the holiday weekend to find my footing. God bless.","careerguidance",1,"https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1h0ejzd/which_career_path_would_you_go_with_at_this_point/",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"676","2024-11-26",1732633849,"Should I throw some vendors under the bus?","I have an overseas contact in India who I trust - I worked in production with him at a former employer who sells to retailers. I quit that job to take another. He quit on his end 6 months later.

Our employer was very sketchy. Didn't pay suppliers. Had cameras on us all day -  I worked in a regular cubicle office with a camera looking at me. Lots of bad things too numerous to mention worse than that. He's also an idiot so I didn't sign a non disclosure or anything when I was hired.

The guy in India knows and saw proof that this former employer ( amongst several others) is messing with the import paperwork and providing qualities of goods that's way less than he states. So if you're buying an item that states what it's made of....it's an actual lie, it's made of something of lower quality. I don't think the Retail Buyer has noticed that he us being told one thing and is selling another. Which is illegal.
They started doing this to be competitive in the market.

So now this guy in India works for someone much better. They have the contacts of those retailers being screwed. I act as the sole rep here in North America to try to get them business with retail buyers,, though I need to still build these relationships, they are only aware that we exist on some level.

Knowing what I know....how do I approach this with buyers who don't know me personally yet?

I kind of want to tell them the short story of what's happening and I can provide them sampling of what they should be getting versus what they have been putting on their shelves. And they do what they want having that information. They also have our offerings too but I don't think have taken seriously yet.

What would you do?

Learn Python by actually practicing the language and doing projects. You have some prior coding experience, so picking up a new language shouldn't be some ordeal. Especially if you want to learn it in the context of data analysis, your prior experience should help you feel things out. But, pick projects that seem interesting and useful, maybe contribute to open source projects, and learn by doing. 

That's not to say you can ignore Leetcode, I just want to be clear about the purpose of everything. Leetcode isn't there to teach you how to be good at Python. It's there so you can learn the little tricks and problems that you'll be interviewed on, even though they have nothing to do with the job itself. It's a separate thing from actually learning python in order to \*do\* the job you want. Leetcode is only to \*get\* the job you want. 

In any case, treat Leetcode like a habit, grind out some problems everyday, and you'll have lots of experience in two or three years. Treat the projects as the method you use to actually learn python. 

But, if you're still interested in data analysis, then you already have a lot of experience and know-how. You're just picking up an additional tool, and it really shouldn't be a huge hassle for you to get a handle on.","1"

first off - the eye strain issue is actually pretty common but totally fixable! get yourself a good blue light filter (either glasses or screen), adjust your screen brightness, and follow the 20-20-20 rule (every 20 mins look at something 20 feet away for 20 secs). these small changes made a huge difference for me.

given your love for math, problem-solving, and working independently, i think you're actually on the right track with data analytics! but here's something interesting to consider - have you thought about getting into AI/ML? its basically the perfect combo of math, problem solving, and analytics. plus with all the new AI tools coming out (like jenova ai which i built), theres huge demand for people who can work with these systems.

business analysis could work too but tbh its usually more about processes and stakeholder management than pure analytics. if you really enjoy the mathematical side of things, you might find it a bit limiting.

quick suggestion - try playing around with some AI tools to analyze data and see if you enjoy it. its a good way to test the waters without committing to anything. most modern AI platforms can help with data analysis, and seeing how they work might give you better insight into what aspects of the field interest you most.","2"

"693","2024-11-26",1732631048," What Career Path Should I Choose? Advice Needed for a 20-Year-Old Who Loves Math and Problem-Solving","Hi everyone,

Im 20 years old and trying to figure out the best career path for myself. Heres a little about my background and interests:

I was studying Business Administration for two years but dropped out. During those two years, we took courses in management, finance, marketing, and accounting. The idea was to specialize after two years, but none of the options excited me.

I then started taking online data analytics courses and became obsessed with the field. I love analyzing things and solving problems. However, I have bad vision, and spending hours on my laptop caused severe eye strain and sleepless nights. This has made me question if its the right path for me.

Heres a bit more about me:

""I love math and problem-solving but hate biology, chemistry, and anything science-related.
""I enjoy working independently in my own space.
""I love psychology and read a lot about it, but Im unsure if its something I want to pursue as a career.

Ive been thinking about business analysis as an option, but Im unsure if it aligns with my skills and interests or if theres another career path that might suit me better.

If you have any advice or suggestions based on my interests and experience, I would really appreciate it! Thank you!","careerguidance",8,"https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1h0d1es/what_career_path_should_i_choose_advice_needed/","EngineeringWeekly582","2024-11-26",1732631970,1,1,0,0,"Replying to Brook_nvk92...thanks for your recommendation i will research this.","4_1"

","I'm 24, I got pregnant at 20, I've spent 3 years being a stay at home mom (but spent a lot of time progressing as an artist and participated in a few shows). My 3 year old can start preschool next year and I'll be a stay at home mom for at least another 2-3 years as I'm pregnant again. I've decided I need to find something to work on for these next couple years. I love my kids but being a stay at home mom isn't fulfilling to me. Once my new youngest is in preschool,  I'd love to be able to have a certificate or degree and start a job that can actually turn into a career (I know I won't be able to immediately start a great career, I'll still have to work my way up but having a degree or certificate just helps to get my foot in the door). 

I was at first thinking I'd love to spend the next 2 years fully committed to art and work on a couple of collections for an exhibit and reach out to galleries. I love art and I'm good at it. But it's one of those things with no guarantee of a pay off. 

On the other hand, ever since I was little I always wanted to work with animals. That was always my dream.  Own an animal sanctuary,  be a zoologist, or maybe an animal rehabilitator. We don't have the money for a 4 year university. I also only have the ability to do school online (at least for now, once my youngest is 1.5 or 2, I'll probably do part time day care). The downside to that is there's really very limited options where we live for an animal related career unless I want to work at the animal shelter. 

So I don't know... are there any certificates or 2 year degrees in the animal field you can get that actually help you with a job? That seems like the route with a more guaranteed pay off (over the art route). Or should I just go for my passion of art and still be able to be more available to my kids/ be home more (my husband works out of town a lot so it is nice to have a parent that's available 24/7).

I think a big stress factor in this decision is my in-laws constantly push for me to get a job or go to school.. and pursuing art (even while being a stay at home mom who takes care of the house and kids) doesn't have enough ""value"" in their eyes. I know I should do what I want anyway,  it's just an added pressure to feel like I don't have any ""achievement"" or tangible goal while stuck in the repetitive life of a being a stay at home mom.

My best advice is to find something in STEM that you _dont entirely dislike_ and go from there. 

See what is needed by the labor market in your area. 

There are a lot of programs that can be completed in 2 years and get you started in the workforce. 

Its good that you have your familys support, but _please_ get something that could enable you to support yourself incase anything happened to your husband.","1"

I'm very lucky that I do have the opportunity to stay home and try to pursue art if i wanted but would I look back in 5-10 years and realize I wasted my time pursuing a career that is essentially a lottery. 

And if anything happened to my husband or if I was ever in a position where we divorced,  I don't want to have nothing to fall back on.  I watched it happen with my mom and it was very hard on her, as well as us kids growing up. 

I do want to find a balance, though, ideally it'd be great to find a way to combine passion and a stable career. Which is why I'm trying to do some research and get some fresh perspectives. Appreciate your comment!","1_1"

Nothing says you couldnt work in a decently paid field and hire a babysitter for a few hours a week while you pursue art/animal activities. Or have an artsy side hustle, like teaching art classes at a community center.

Once my new youngest is in preschool,  I'd love to be able to have a certificate or degree and start a job that can actually turn into a career (I know I won't be able to immediately start a great career, I'll still have to work my way up but having a degree or certificate just helps to get my foot in the door). 

I was at first thinking I'd love to spend the next 2 years fully committed to art and work on a couple of collections for an exhibit and reach out to galleries. I love art and I'm good at it. But it's one of those things with no guarantee of a pay off. 

On the other hand, ever since I was little I always wanted to work with animals. That was always my dream.  Own an animal sanctuary,  be a zoologist, or maybe an animal rehabilitator. We don't have the money for a 4 year university. I also only have the ability to do school online (at least for now, once my youngest is 1.5 or 2, I'll probably do part time day care). The downside to that is there's really very limited options where we live for an animal related career unless I want to work at the animal shelter. 

So I don't know... are there any certificates or 2 year degrees in the animal field you can get that actually help you with a job? That seems like the route with a more guaranteed pay off (over the art route). Or should I just go for my passion of art and still be able to be more available to my kids/ be home more (my husband works out of town a lot so it is nice to have a parent that's available 24/7).

I think a big stress factor in this decision is my in-laws constantly push for me to get a job or go to school.. and pursuing art (even while being a stay at home mom who takes care of the house and kids) doesn't have enough ""value"" in their eyes. I know I should do what I want anyway,  it's just an added pressure to feel like I don't have any ""achievement"" or tangible goal while stuck in the repetitive life of a being a stay at home mom.

I was at first thinking I'd love to spend the next 2 years fully committed to art and work on a couple of collections for an exhibit and reach out to galleries. I love art and I'm good at it. But it's one of those things with no guarantee of a pay off. 

On the other hand, ever since I was little I always wanted to work with animals. That was always my dream.  Own an animal sanctuary,  be a zoologist, or maybe an animal rehabilitator. We don't have the money for a 4 year university. I also only have the ability to do school online (at least for now, once my youngest is 1.5 or 2, I'll probably do part time day care). The downside to that is there's really very limited options where we live for an animal related career unless I want to work at the animal shelter. 

So I don't know... are there any certificates or 2 year degrees in the animal field you can get that actually help you with a job? That seems like the route with a more guaranteed pay off (over the art route). Or should I just go for my passion of art and still be able to be more available to my kids/ be home more (my husband works out of town a lot so it is nice to have a parent that's available 24/7).

I think a big stress factor in this decision is my in-laws constantly push for me to get a job or go to school.. and pursuing art (even while being a stay at home mom who takes care of the house and kids) doesn't have enough ""value"" in their eyes.

In my community, I often see people posting asking about animal grooming and nail cutting. At least in the state I live in, you don't need any certification or license to be a dog groomer. You'd have to check with your state laws, and even if there aren't legal requirements, you would probably want to set up an LLC and create it as a business (relatively easy and inexpensive). I also see a lot of people asking for dog training - again, you may not need a license or certification for this - though receiving one will help credibility. 

You're good at art - combine this with your passion of animals - do commission work for pet portraits. 

You have a lot going on, so in proceeding, make it scalable - but I see potentially a combination of going to school online/part time for vet tech, do animal grooming as a job, and then art on the side. 

You're still young, you have littles in the house. The above suggestions I feel are a good starting point and all have room for further growth as you get older and the kids get older.","9"

","I'm 24, I got pregnant at 20, I've spent 3 years being a stay at home mom (but spent a lot of time progressing as an artist and participated in a few shows). My 3 year old can start preschool next year and I'll be a stay at home mom for at least another 2-3 years as I'm pregnant again. I've decided I need to find something to work on for these next couple years. I love my kids but being a stay at home mom isn't fulfilling to me. Once my new youngest is in preschool,  I'd love to be able to have a certificate or degree and start a job that can actually turn into a career (I know I won't be able to immediately start a great career, I'll still have to work my way up but having a degree or certificate just helps to get my foot in the door). 

I was at first thinking I'd love to spend the next 2 years fully committed to art and work on a couple of collections for an exhibit and reach out to galleries. I love art and I'm good at it. But it's one of those things with no guarantee of a pay off. 

On the other hand, ever since I was little I always wanted to work with animals. That was always my dream.  Own an animal sanctuary,  be a zoologist, or maybe an animal rehabilitator. We don't have the money for a 4 year university. I also only have the ability to do school online (at least for now, once my youngest is 1.5 or 2, I'll probably do part time day care). The downside to that is there's really very limited options where we live for an animal related career unless I want to work at the animal shelter. 

So I don't know... are there any certificates or 2 year degrees in the animal field you can get that actually help you with a job?

","I'm 24, I got pregnant at 20, I've spent 3 years being a stay at home mom (but spent a lot of time progressing as an artist and participated in a few shows). My 3 year old can start preschool next year and I'll be a stay at home mom for at least another 2-3 years as I'm pregnant again. I've decided I need to find something to work on for these next couple years. I love my kids but being a stay at home mom isn't fulfilling to me. Once my new youngest is in preschool,  I'd love to be able to have a certificate or degree and start a job that can actually turn into a career (I know I won't be able to immediately start a great career, I'll still have to work my way up but having a degree or certificate just helps to get my foot in the door). 

I was at first thinking I'd love to spend the next 2 years fully committed to art and work on a couple of collections for an exhibit and reach out to galleries. I love art and I'm good at it. But it's one of those things with no guarantee of a pay off. 

On the other hand, ever since I was little I always wanted to work with animals. That was always my dream.  Own an animal sanctuary,  be a zoologist, or maybe an animal rehabilitator. We don't have the money for a 4 year university. I also only have the ability to do school online (at least for now, once my youngest is 1.5 or 2, I'll probably do part time day care). The downside to that is there's really very limited options where we live for an animal related career unless I want to work at the animal shelter.

This doesn't imply all processes are necessarily *hateful*, you may very well enjoy what you do. It's just that it is bound to become repetitive after a while.

The comment about startups is accurate: the more immature the company, the more of a messy mixup it will be - the downside is the stress and intensity of living in a boiling pot all the time. As the company matures, the mess will be sorted out to discard the useless and keep only what works, which will be formalized into processes as efficient, effective, repetitive and boring processes - the mess means wasted money.","5"

- class at local community college (or online grad certificates, or edx) - theres tons of online options now that can give you taste of a career change. I promise if youre bored sitting through a lecture or doing the reading youll be bored working that kind of job

- network!  Depending on your community anything from rotary to yoga class you can find someone that has experience in that industry. Ask questions, build a relationship. Im not talking about one off networking events, a group that meets weekly or monthly and you can get to know someone.

I think your framework is a little off. If you look at peoples resumes you will see that they have held variety of jobs over the course of their careers. You get a job you learn it, when it stops being interesting you grow or change. Along the way, your life can change. Maybe you become comfortable and risk averse. Maybe you have responsibilities that make it difficult for you to make changes. 

People get stuck often due to circumstances outside of their control. For me, I have always found it helpful to just move towards things I am interested in. For example I dislike boring, repetitive tasks and work to automate them when possible. Soon I become a specialist in this and my role changes. I have never worked on a team where there was not room for process improvement. 

Look for roles and teams that are a good fit for you. Some people like structure and predictability some like not knowing what is around the next corner. There is no good and bad there is just suitable and not suitable for you. Different companies/teams can tackle the same task in using completely different approaches.   Find your tribe. 

Always have a goal  somewhere out in the future, what do you want your life to be like in 5 years. Move in that direction. Reevaluate every year and change the goal as you change but always keep challenge as a part of your life.","21"

Had a phone interview with HR, and it went wellwe scheduled an in-person interview for the following Monday. Before the interview, they sent me an assessment, which I completed on Sunday.

Monday morning, I received an email saying I failed the assessment. No big dealits not the first time in my career thats happened. I emailed HR back to ask if they could share my scores so I could improve for the future.

Immediately after, I got a phone call from HR apologizing for the confusion. Despite my failing the assessment, the hiring manager wanted to make an exception and proceed with the interview.

The interview itself went pretty well. It lasted about 1.5 hours. However, every time I asked about the position, the hiring manager focused on how he had been doing the reports himself and seemed frustrated or burned out with it. It felt like he just wanted to offload the task.

I also asked about who had done the reports before, and it sounded like no one hadit was unclear if the role even existed in its current form.

After the interview, they gave me a tour of the building, almost like they were already assuming Id get the job. The office was mostly emptymaybe 20-30 employees in totalbut they claim to have a staff of 300-400. It felt odd. (2 days WFH, 3 days in office)

Then, while driving home (not even 20 minutes after leaving), I got a phone call with an offer from HR.

Heres where Im conflicted:

The manager seemed eager to get rid of a task theyd been handling.

The office was nearly empty, even though its supposedly a large company.

The offer came less than 20 minutes after I leftvery rushed.

It just sounds like they really need someone--you might even have room to negotiate a higher salary. 

If you put yourself in the managers shoes, offloading tasks is literally why you hire people. Have you ever worked somewhere and had wait too much work on your plate? The issue is typically that there's too much work for the number of staff, so to rectify that, it's good that they're hiring someone.

About the empty office--are some people allowed to work hybrid or remote? That would be a great question for them if you don't know yet--literally asking why the office seemed empty is fine! 

The only hesitation I would have is, and this is going to sound kind of bad, but are they always desperate and just hiring anyone? That could be indicative of larger issues and even put into question whether this is a high performing team/company that's trying to get good talent. That's only really a concern if you want to stay there long term versus early in your career and just trying to get experience. If it's the latter, no biggie, you can move on in a year.

im in the process of applying to fashion jobs. i graduated in Art Direction and communication, just to make you understand where im coming from. 

however im really stuck creatively speaking and i have been thinking on this idea for a while:
theres a brand that i really love, i always got inspired from them, the way they work and the actual creative process inside there, even more than the final product itself. i love their mindset. its not a very big brand i would say same size as Adriana Hot Couture (i feel its mainstream enough for more people to know), mine is more undercover.

they have not listing jobs and i also dont speak the language (i know im dreaming mostly). but anyway i feel like i am kinda meant to be there. i would do whatever to be there, i really dont expect to be taken seriously and have a job or an internship and an happy ending.
their process, mindset and inspiration are so intimate to me, and i know i have the skills to do literally whatever they want me to do: being pr, social media, art direction, photo studio assistant, casting, assistant of the assistant, literary whatever. i have a lot of small job experiences literally everywhere. 
so my question is mainly if i am delusional. if i send them a very good and heartfelt cover letter of why i need to be there and why i know i can do it. and maybe attaching two portfolios? a real one and one of me? i was thinking about making a me portfolio, about me as a person in hope to show them like look i am you, you are me kinda vibe. 
is it too unserious? or is it how i feel it is? am i making sense?

New job is going through fda inspection high stress great career opportunity as I specialize in a niche and career advancement is on the table. I was referred by a consultant that said I performed well in my last fda inspection and brought me in and went over there salary expectations for the position with high growth 3 products approved public stocks with RSUs given every year and an annual stock incentive for positive results in fda inspection dec 2025. I will have limited time off for my baby since I'm new and need to prove myself Its a small industry and if I turn down an accepted job offer looks bad on my part.

Looking for advice as I have been over worked and underpaid at my current job as they dangle the carrot in front of all employees on the potential incentive.","careerguidance",1,"https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1h0b58l/do_i_turn_down_the_big_equity_payout/","Ancientways113","2024-11-26",1732626325,1,1,0,0,"IMO, March is close enough to wait.

Depends on where you're claiming asylum. Since you're still in a closet, it's unclear if you have sufficient evidence at the moment. Contact LGBT non-profit organizations in the country that you're thinking or consult a lawyer to see if this is a viable option or not. 

&gt;2) keep working til I get an offer from somewhere else, but that might take years.. 

You still need to financially support yourself so makes sense to do this until you have better options.

&gt;3) university, I've saved enough for that

You didn't mention the country, but this is typically the easiest and most direct way to immigrate for a lot of countries and usually have some pathways to work and then gain permanent residency. I think this is probably the most ideal imo because it doesn't tie your immigration status to your trans identity and you can come out at your own time if and when you feel safe in your new community. 

&gt;4) a friend wants to marry me, but I'll then be in the US and that's scary. Does open doors though. 

If this is not a true marriage but a charity gesture from your friend, it's technically immigration fraud and I wouldn't recommend it. Especially when you're trans and middle eastern in an anti-immigration anti-trans trump administration. If your ""marriage"" is scrutinized sufficiently and you're discovered to commit marriage fraud for immigration purposes, both you and your friend will suffer consequences.","17"

Im in a bit of a tough spot and would appreciate your advice. Ive been accepted into the University at Buffalo's Computer Science program, and Im also enrolled in the ICM to UM pathway in Canada. The problem is, Ive already paid a $14k deposit for the ICM program, and while Im pretty sure I wont get a refund, Im still trying to see if theres any way I can get it back.

Now Im torn between two options: should I lose most of the deposit and just go ahead with the US program at UB, or should I start my studies in Canada and try to transfer after a year to UB? The Canada route seems like a safer option financially, but I really want to end up at UB in the long run.

Has anyone been in a similar situation, or does anyone have advice on the best route to take? Thanks a lot for your help!

I think companies would respond better if you interview first and then ask about possible accommodations to your conditions. If you havent even had a full conversation with them and youre already asking for accommodations they are in their full right to look for other candidates, but if you show your worth and they want you, its more likely for them to be willing to be flexible.

Something to consider, and you can reject this since I dont know the full scope of your disabilities, is to be open to in-office accommodations vs straight up requiring working from home. If theres a short commute or they offer transportation or a carpool program, maybe you can come to the office. The temperature thing is also a big assumption, not every office will be extremely cold and to the uneducated might sound like a jacket or something like that can take care of it. 

Basically, dont just assume recruiters will take your word for it especially with some of the details you provide. Businesses are businesses, therefore they lack empathy. You cant just expect them to feel bad for you from getting tired quickly and being cold, you need to make yourself valuable to them and then negotiate how to make things work.","1"

I have worked many many jobs, everything from dealing with animal waste to a cozy office job with a window seat, performing computer tasks.

When I see a ""problem"" or an issue that hinders production, (whatever the end goal is ), and I have to approach a supervisor who is 30 years younger than I it is awkward.  

I deal with a Backlog of computer-related issues and Health Insurance  
Every year at the same time the backlog climbs and climbs, as it will soon start, well it's starting.

In the scope of my job, we have several things we deal with to solve the problem

Federal Laws  
State Laws  
Internal Quality Assurance  
Management Requirements - Production goals

Each STEP just creates its issue - I could for example have an issue where a person's coverage was terminated for not complying with a request to supply additional information and wants their coverage reinstated.

In the Private world, I would get the issue, and fix it, it would take me all of 10 min

In a Government Agency World it requires

1; An in-depth analysis of the request  
2: Documenting in your own words the request  
3: Documenting all notices, sent to the individual and when and what kind  
4: Searching to see if the documents are on file  
5: An outbound call to the individual up to 2 calls with at least 24 hours between each call  
6: Speaking to the individual, getting the documents if they had not already submitted them, fixing the problem while on the phone with the individual,   
7: Explain EVERYTHING that is about to happen, and how long it will take to fix  
8: Send a request to the Insurance Carrier to confirm that the transaction was received  
9: Call the member and let them know  
10: Document all calls, all actions, and the reasons: Who, What, When, and Why  
11: Copy all notes and put them onto the individual files, along with the Customer Service System  
12: Close case

12 steps in a Government job to fix a problem that takes less than 10 min.

If in the scope of your job, you identify a problem that could be resolved I suggest

1: Identify the problem  
2: explain the steps currently to resolve the problem  
3; Give at least 2 if not 3 ways to FIX and improve the resolution of that problem

"882","2024-11-27",1732702196,"Found out I'm being let go in 6 months, what should I look for?","TL;DR:
- Degree in Business Data Analytics
- One year in Business Valuations
- One year as a Bookkeeper while in college
- In California, working remote, but open to options
- No clue what jobs to look for in related fields

I am going to try to be as concise as possible without this sounding like a sob story, I'm just really losing faith in myself here. This was supposed to be my chance to fix our financial situation and give us a life.

I graduated in 2023 with a degree in Business Data Analytics. I was offered a job in Business Valuations contingent upon getting my degree, so I never looked at anything else. My employer is someone I have known for ages, and she ran her own firm of just two (now three) people. Three months in, we merged with another, much larger, company. They wanted my boss, but she said we were a package deal (her, myself, and the other employee). They accepted and even gave me a pay increase, plus they brought me on without requiring that I complete the internship program. While that sounds great, it shot me in the foot. I had three months of very limited experience. The merger was official in January.

Everything seemed to be going great until my boss announced her retirement a few months ago, effective May 2025. They had initially said that I would have a place with them, not to worry, but we learned in October that the Valuations department didn't do well this past year and they were making cuts. Given her retirement, which ""wasn't part of the deal"", they're letting me go at that time as well.

I feel like I can't breathe. I've known for almost two months now, but every day is harder to stay focused knowing I have an expiration date. I have ADHD/ASD and the anxiety is giving me panic attacks whenever I see the names of the managers and partners who know I'm being let go. I know I can do well, and I was learning so much, but I feel like I'm falling on my face and I have no direction now.

I feel I've only barely been introduced to so many different fields that I don't know where to look. Financial analysis, accounting, limited SQL and Python experience, those are the things I studied. I live in California and need to make $70k+. Where can I go from here?

I digressed a bit and joined an aviation program at a university but decided it wasnt for me and got a bachelors in communication design. 

I am now a working graphic artist and I cant imagine doing anything else not related to the creative field.

When speaking, be loud enough to be heard, but not loud, speak in a normal tone, but not monotone, when shaking hands be firm, but not painful, shake their hand like you're in control.

Stand with your shoulders straight, head up, and walk with confidence and determination but don't appear to be all that either.  Its a balance.  A simple Hello, a smile, can go a long way.

Just want to preface this by saying I'm in the EU, Croatia to be more specific.

I graduated Uni (master of science in mechanical engineering) in July and started in my new, basically dream, position in September. The job is great, I like what I do, I make enough money and I like the people I interact with regularly.

In the meantime, somewhere around March or April, my freelancing started taking off. I currently have multiple  clients, all of which have expressed great interest in a longer term relationships (some of them I've already done multiple projects with). All in all, I earn almost as much doing freelancing after work (around 10 hours a week) as I do at my ""real"" job (40 hours a week). I'm also confident I would have enough freelance work to do for about 30 hours a week for at least the next year. And all of this is without actively seeking new clients. I'd also like to add that I enjoy the freelancing stuff as much as the ""real"" job, if not more, though it does cause me more stress because I take on more responsibility personally.

I've only been at the ""real"" job for three months now, and there's a six-month probation built into my 2-year contract. Obviously, as a recent grad, I've been learning so much here and it has been very beneficial for my professional growth. I originally intended to work through the 2-year contract and then consider going full time freelance. However, since the freelance work has been growing, I'm thinking about ending it after the 6-month probation period.

I'm young enough and confident enough to be willing to take the risk now, but my biggest concern is what happens when the freelancing stuff dries out. I'm worried I'll be missing out on some natural career progress and promotions, and that I'll be stuck back in junior roles if, for example, in 6 years I have to find a ""real"" job again. Additionally, I'm also questioning whether or not I should stick it for the entire 2-year contract just for the real world experience (supplier and manufacturing communication, network connections, and the knowledge and experience from the seniors that I can tap into here at my company). I value this highly because I have ambitions of developing my own products and starting a goods company at some point.

Overall, I think short term (next couple of years) freelancing is the better option, but I just don't have the experience or the foresight to know whether it's a good decision now for the long term.","careerguidance",0,"https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1h10td1/stay_at_real_job_or_go_full_time_freelance_as_a/",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This year, I graduated from a pretty good university in my country, majoring in Industrial Engineering. During my studies, I did internships at various companies, including a manufacturing plant and an e-commerce company.

Personally, I prefer working in a manufacturing environment because the culture felt less toxic and more candid compared to office settings. In one of my office-based internships, for example, my boss claimed credit for my work, which was quite frustrating. Additionally, I enjoyed learning about other engineering disciplines, such as electrical, mechanical, and chemical engineering, during my time in manufacturingareas not heavily covered in my degree, which focused more on process improvement, supply chain management (SCM), and simulation.

After graduating, I started job hunting, aiming specifically for a role in a manufacturing plant. Fortunately, I landed a job fairly quickly and began working there. I went through training, took on various miscellaneous tasks, and got to meet senior workers and engineers.

However, my current role doesnt really utilize my degree. Most of my tasks involve designing labels for export and import purposes and developing product labels. While I dont dislike the work, I frequently get asked the same question by senior colleagues, and its starting to bother me:

I think it looks better putting at least a few years into any place before searching for a new position. 

But its definitely better eventually searching for a new position vs staying at any company where you initially start. 

Some firms do not always internally promote and when they do the pay increase is much less than the same position on the market with another company because they initially hired you at a much lower rate and when market for the entry level role was probably less.","1_1_1"

Im a 2020 BTech graduate (Electronics and Electrical Engineering) with 3.10 years of experience as an SAP ABAP developer.

	1.	Should I keep focusing on job applications and interviews?
	2.	Should I pursue certifications (e.g., SAP BTP, SAP Fiori) or training? Any recommendations for hands-on institutes?
	3.	Should I consider a masters degree? If yes, which field can keep me in SAP or help me switch careers effectively?

I'm in my late 20s, currently in a consulting role for a tech company and I've been here for almost 3 years. Recently, I've been feeling increasingly anxious/burnt out due to work and, after seeing a therapist for a year, I decided I would need a wellness leave for a couple of months to recover and focus on my mental health. I have a clinical letter written by my therapist and we're making a plan together of how I want to spend my wellness leave to recover and come back to my role. My manager was very supportive at first, allowing me to rest and come back but, upper management seems to disagree. They are pushing me to look for jobs at other companies or to transfer to a ""less stressful"" department in the current company. Reason being if I am burnt out, they think I will continue to be stressed in the future since the nature of the job won't change when I come back so, it will hurt me and hurt the company if I'm not performing well due to mental health.   
  
Now, my manager is also pressuring me to make a decision (to try to transfer to an ""easy"" role in the company or to look for another job) ASAP in the next few weeks. ASAP because they need to plan the team structure before the end of year and they cannot wait for me to come back from my leave. I let him know I am dedicate to my current role/team but just need some time to get back on my feet however, he is now also repeating what upper management is saying and that maybe I'm just not suitable for this.   
  
All the performance feedback prior to asking for a wellness leave was overall positive since I joined the company, so I feel blind sighted. I don't feel like it's worth it fighting for anything since I don't want to stay in my current team if my manager doesn't believe in me :/ Already dealing with burn out and this added pressure of job security is making me more stressed..  thanks in advance :)

"918","2024-11-27",1732693690,"I have a call with my boss tomorrow. How do I tell them I feel underpaid?","I work as a Social media manager and content creator for a small startup. I started off doing it for $500/month because I needed money. I even exaggerated my credentials but was confident in my work. I ended up doing such a good job growing the page, but I dropped my effort since it wasnt enough pay. My boss noticed and started to pay me $35 per Instagram reel for 6-8 posts a week.

Now they bumped it to $60 per video filmed OUTSIDE my bedroom. I agree the outdoor videos perform much better on avg, but some indoor videos do well too. The problem is I dont see why the videos I film indoors should be $35 since they still require effort and sometimes do perform well thus generating product leads. 

The main problem is I feel undervalued for my industry. Freelance social media mangers typically have retainer fees of 1000-2k/ month and I dont even make $1000/ mo. I realized I could just start filming every video outside my home And earn $1440/ mo ( 6 videos x $60), but theres a logistics issue:

For each video I film, I need someone to record and move angles  something a tripod cant do. People are busy and I typically dont get to film until my friend gets out of class or my sister gets home from work. By this time its usually night and I have nowhere else to film besides my home or my friends bedroom Mine isn't as visually pleasing. Sometimes I film at the bar but I can only do it so much. On top of that, I pay my friend $10 per video to record.

My boss gets onto me about consistently hitting 6-8 videos per week (i do the minimum of 6) and is asking me to start batch recording videos  which is something Im working on during the holidays.

My boss also hires influencers in India to promote our product. They paid one guy like $80 for 1 video. I did 2 videos recently in my friends room and it performed similar, if not better than the influencers yet I got paid $35 for each --I wouldve been happy with $60 each. Things like this make me feel undervalued Like if I put out a video from indoors and it gets a million views plus high CTR, it would still be $35

My boss wants to call me tomorrow to check in and possibly have me on board full-time in January. Im not sure how full time differs from my current structure. While I enjoy the work I do in a sense, its the fact that Im not earning a monthly salary Im satisfied with. I was thinking of mentioning this during our call, but Im not sure how theyll react.

I was thinking to ask my boss if they can increase my indoor videos to $45 and provide a monthly bonus at a rate of $0.05 per link tap (I got 10k clicks last month). My boss is somewhat reasonable and laid back but I feel Ive proved my worth.

I dont have any other jobs right now so I dont want to lose this. Although, I do so good i feel it would be more work to find someone else.
Can anyone offer advice on how to approach this situation?","careerguidance",0,"https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1h0z6d0/i_have_a_call_with_my_boss_tomorrow_how_do_i_tell/",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

If you go the RSA route for bars and nightclubs, you probably wont need a bartending course right awaymany places will start you as a barback or runner and train you on the job.

As for the job hunt, try both in-person and online. Visiting stores with your resume can show initiative, but applying online to supermarkets or chain stores gives you more reach. And dont forget places like cinemas, gyms, or even tutoring if youre good at any subjectsthey love hiring students.

"927","2024-11-27",1732691737,"Thinking of declining a job offer after being unemployed for over a year. Are these red flags, or am I just acting too entitled?","I am married and in my early 40s with \~$1.2M net worth and no major financial overhead (we rent our place, don't have/want kids, and don't spend a ton). My wife and I can realistically continue living comfortably for a while before things get really desperate. Nevertheless, I am beginning to feel very anxious -- like I NEED to get back to earning a paycheck soon. I should note that I have struggled to manage my anxiety (in general) for a long time, even when I was well compensated at my last job.

I began looking for a new job \~8 months ago, and despite landing many interviews, I believe my anxiety got in the way of converting interviews into job offers. Now that I finally have a job offer, I am doubting whether to accept it. The pay would be decent (at best), but I think there's a good chance the job could make me miserable.

Are these red flags or am I just acting too entitled???

1. The role is based in the United States, but the company is a WITCH company (Wipro, Infosys, Tata, Cognizant, HCL). These are well-known companies that operate \~75% of their staff in India. I have heard mixed-reviews about work-life balance and treatment of employees.
2. The role is WFH, but I'm worried about work/life balance. The hiring manager says he typically starts the day \~6:30am and works until 5-6pm. I've very rarely taken video calls before 9am...am I being unrealistic to ask whether I could start at 9am? Would it be crazy to turn down a job offer just because I'm not a ""morning person""? I'm worried I will burnout.
3. I initially interviewed for an entirely different role. The role they are offering me now seems like a lot more work. I'm really skeptical about this ""bait &amp; switch"" move...
4. Half-way through the recruitment process, my recruiter ""left"" the company and I was assigned a different recruiter.

I'm worried that if I do not accept this offer (\~$200K salary, low/no bonus, no equity), I might not see another offer for a long time. Is it naive to expect to find a good-paying WFH job in this market that doesn't have some kind of ""catch""?","careerguidance",10,"https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1h0yq8l/thinking_of_declining_a_job_offer_after_being/","CaliKoukla","2024-11-27",1732692448,4,4,0,0,"Based on the salary and unemployment running out, I say take the offer.

I began looking for a new job \~8 months ago, and despite landing many interviews, I believe my anxiety got in the way of converting interviews into job offers. Now that I finally have a job offer, I am doubting whether to accept it. The pay would be decent (at best), but I think there's a good chance the job could make me miserable.

Are these red flags or am I just acting too entitled???

1. The role is based in the United States, but the company is a WITCH company (Wipro, Infosys, Tata, Cognizant, HCL). These are well-known companies that operate \~75% of their staff in India. I have heard mixed-reviews about work-life balance and treatment of employees.
2. The role is WFH, but I'm worried about work/life balance. The hiring manager says he typically starts the day \~6:30am and works until 5-6pm. I've very rarely taken video calls before 9am...am I being unrealistic to ask whether I could start at 9am? Would it be crazy to turn down a job offer just because I'm not a ""morning person""? I'm worried I will burnout.
3. I initially interviewed for an entirely different role. The role they are offering me now seems like a lot more work. I'm really skeptical about this ""bait &amp; switch"" move...
4. Half-way through the recruitment process, my recruiter ""left"" the company and I was assigned a different recruiter.

I'm worried that if I do not accept this offer (\~$200K salary, low/no bonus, no equity), I might not see another offer for a long time. Is it naive to expect to find a good-paying WFH job in this market that doesn't have some kind of ""catch""?","careerguidance",10,"https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1h0yq8l/thinking_of_declining_a_job_offer_after_being/","Ok_BoomerSF","2024-11-27",1732692644,5,5,0,0,"Youre being too entitled.

Talk to a few employees (past and present) about work-life balance and treatment of employees.

Ask your hiring manager if you can take video calls after 9 a.m.

""Seems like a lot of work"" - make sure one of the employees you talk to is in a similar role as yours so you can vet if this is a case.

Regarding the anxiety part: If you have finances, there's no need to get a job you don't feel fits your needs or wants. You will need to resolve this, however, to make sure you can present your best self when you interview. I believe that people can read your energy.

They operate solely based on the project and the client. They may have some universal rules ( like bonus system, promotions and etc), but general work-life balance is strictly connected to the nature of their contract and $$$. 

For example, in one project the client will say : I need a specific number of managers, TL, Analysts, Engineers and everyone else. And the pay will be paid for the headcount. In this case it is often not that terrible, because the requirements are more or less adequate. In other cases the client just pays $$$ without any saying in hiring and WITCH tries to cut all possible costs and earn as much as possible. 

I saw it with my own eyes. The same country, the same city, the same client.

In Project A the client paid for every administrative role like TL, Manager, Trainer. The work was nice, analysts got enough support from the Leadership, the organization was pretty good. If you are hired like a Manager there, you won a jackpot.

In Project B the client didn't pay for the administrative roles, so there was a constant lack of everyone. More responsibilities, bigger teams, burnouts and chaos as a result of constant lack of resources.

These WITCH companies all suck by definition, but at the end of the day it is a gamble.","4_1"

","Ive been offered a role as a Senior Marketing Communication Specialist at a company, but its really more of an entry-level position. Right now, Ive been working as a Product Marketing Analyst for the past 2.5 years. My current job gives me job security, but it doesnt offer much in terms of learning or growth. Most of what I do is just research that doesnt lead anywhere, and it feels pretty repetitive and unfulfilling. The pay isnt great either, but if I stick around long enough, say 8+ years, I could potentially move into a leadership role.

The new job sounds pretty promising, though. It comes with a 30% salary increase, the chance to work with an offshore team, and Im hoping there will be more opportunities to learn and grow. The thing thats making me hesitant is that taking the new role would basically mean starting over in an entry-level position. Id have to rebuild my experience and career path from the ground up, and Im not sure if its worth taking a step backward to move forward in the long run.","careerguidance",1,"https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1h0yg80/offered_a_pay_raise_but_its_an_entry_level_role/","Peeky_Rules","2024-11-27",1732694065,1,1,0,0,"I would take the Sr. Marketing Communication Specialist position.

But I still need to feed the wolf at the door, and I would ideally like to have some money to engage in hobbies and travel sometimes, so I need a job that at least pays adequately. 

I know such jobs are probably very hard to come by and people probably like to keep them a secret, and different people are stressed by different things. 

I don't care if it's not fulfilling - I can volunteer and fill my heart another way. 

And it can be across any field - I'm looking at returning to study anyway.

Don't worry about your ""reputation"" in your family.

The trades aren't some sort of dumping ground for idiots, layabouts and losers. You need a decent brain, self-discipline, common sense and a dash of creative thinking to succeed in any skilled trade.

The reward is a serious, well-paid and in-demand job. Those are getting harder and harder to find for university graduates, who are now ten-a-penny.

Having that piece of paper will boost your life forever, and it doesn't matter how low your grades were to get it, as long as you finish. You can do anything you want all the time, anyway, getting it won't stop you from doing other things, but literally until you die your status in society will be higher because of that piece of paper, even if you never use it for shit. 

Best part is, you'll *never* have to do it again, either. 80 years later, if you never read a book again in your life, that piece of paper will be working for you.

*Details*:

I was an HVAC technician, myself, and now teach HVAC for the college. I have two associate degrees and am an Air Force veteran, and the fact that I have two AS (in HVAC, which only offers an AS, and the other in accounting) still holds me back daily. 

Even though I'm well into *career* I'm going to have to find a way to squeeze out another two years at university to get a bachelor's in literally *anything* so I am promoteable to the highest level in my career (which I deserve by far, it's obvious.)

I run my own business as well (HVAC, of course!), but if I had that bachelor's, the positions I could be promoted to in administration would make me massive money with half the effort. 

I also didn't know it at the time, but I should have went for engineering, instead of HVAC, because then I could get the super high income jobs designing equipment, which I could do *now* but am not allowed to, because... *associate degree.*

And don't worry about student debt. You can stave that shit off for decades, and it may be forgiven, anyway, by the government. And if you go into a public service job, you can get it written off. Make massive money as some fat administrator for the city, and ALSO get your loan written off.","15"

1. You are ONLY 20 years old and apparently, you still don't have the slightest bit of experience in anything. Get experience even in areas you don't like. This is much better than nothing.

2. Finish college. Whether you like the area or not, the diploma will already be guaranteed if you need to change your plans in the future;

3. Day Trade is only a profession for those who sell courses on how to be a trader. You probably don't have an emergency fund, you don't have assets and you want to risk what little you have in operations where you lose more than you gain. I suggest setting up assets before that and ""trading"" only the part that knows that if it is lost it will not be missed;

When we really sat down and talked about it, she just hated the program. It was not her passion and she couldnt see doing anything like that. She changed majors to things she loved and thrived - then Covid hit. She did not do well online and dropped out. She did some soul searching and realized she loved the hands on working with people things and just graduated with a degree in occupational therapy and she LOVES what she is doing. 

My son got a degree is business and it just is what it is. He uses bits and pieces of it, but ended up back in the restaurant business. Now he is in management so he is coming the two. Hes as happy as Ive seen him. 

As for taking some time off&it took me 10 years to finish undergrad then I immediately went to grad school. I found my calling then life stepped in&I had a special needs baby and we moved to another state that didnt support my MS. I went back into business and loved some, hated some, but was never super passionate about it. 

As a side hustle, Ive bartended for decades. I love it. Ive always made better money than many of my friends with fancy degrees and often more than I made in my professional capacity. 

That said&my customers who have the most expendable incomes and are the most easily employed constantly are all in trades because there is a HUGE need! When a 4 year uni degree became expected, the trade schools lost enrollment. As a result, the pricing for their services went up and they are in demand!!! They can pick and choose their jobs and make serious money. I will also add&they are HAPPY!!! They often set their own hours. Get premium emergency rates and I do not know a single person who looks down on them once they realize how much they need them!!

Example&the guy who helps me with my pool charges others $700/month for maintenance. He comes in once a week for an hour. Emergency electricians charge $300 just to walk in the house. Plumbers? Same things. HVAC? Same thing but usually more. Handyman? Minimum of $75/hour for this and that. Contractors? Thousands for a project that takes a few days to a few weeks. Septic tank company? $600 - it takes them an hour. My favorite local entrepreneur bought a trash truck. We live in an area without city trash pickup. We pay $100 month. He comes through once a week and hits 50 houses in a few hours, dumps it and starts again. 

As a mom of 4 adult children who have all gone down different paths - happiness is everything. My customers who have desk jobs or corporate jobs come to the bar to destress and complain. The contractors and trade people - come in with their teams to chill out and relax.","38"

A bunch of regards make this mistake about college. They had it easy in highschool and don't really understand how college works. This is coming from someone out of STEM too. The class room is just a quick review session or for asking questions. It's not really for learning much, you do the learning by studying for between 10 to 30 hours per test per class. A lot of regards just go into college thinking class is where the learning is done, it's hilarious, that's why they drop like flys after the first 2 semesters. I would get your bachelor's degree even if you go into HVAC just in case, remember if you leave school you only have a handful of years until those credits expire and you have to retake all of those classes all over again. If you are just in your first semester then yeah sure F it. Business is pretty easy imo, and yes I have an MBA too.

If you like reading, learning, thinking over big ideas and sharing your thoughts, then you might want to stay in uni and look around at other fields of study to find something that is a better fit. But if you like being active, working with your hands, getting concrete results and fixing things, trades might be the right direction. I went the academic route because I just really enjoy gaining knowledge and putting ideas into practice. But I have lots of friends who went into the trades and they are doing all kinds of things. Some are business owners. One friend works for the city and she is like the #2 boss for all of the regions water management. One started out as a mechanic and now flies planes for spotting wildfires. One started out in construction, discovered that a lot of his buddies were struggling with addiction, went back to school for one year to get a mental health worker degree and now runs a recovery program specifically for construction workers. One was a dry Waller for a while and discovered he really likes occupational safety and got all his advanced first aid training, and now hes the on site medic. Another got super involved in his union and ended up moving into full time work for the union.

She will need about another semester and a half to finish her BA now that she has graduated with her OT degree. She will go back a class or two at a time once she gets her OT work in hand. You do not have to give up one completely to do something else. With a degree in nursing, you should be able to utilize a lot of your credits for a more targeted degree combining the two when you are ready. Credits dont just die away - BUT if you can stay within the same school system, you will have a better chance of not losing credits.

I know employers worry that graduates are just going to quit the moment they find a job in their field but, to be honest, I genuinely would like to work a ""first job"" or ""no experience needed"" job for a few years as I don't feel fully ready to jump into a career yet.

I take the piercings out for interviews (except for the few occasions I've applied to places like BlueBanana and other edgier shops) and I dress smartly with minimal makeup.","careerguidance",3,"https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1h0uel9/university_graduate_but_i_cant_even_get_a_job_in/","thepandapear","2024-11-27",1732737112,1,1,0,0,"First off, youre not a failure, and your situation is way more common than you think.

My boss and I have never really gelled but things have gotten bad this fall. We had a serious incident at work that I had to respond to (not my fault) and although I did my best it has dragged on and she has had to get involved. Honestly she doesnt have much more skill than I do but I do feel like she is resentful that it wasnt resolved without her. I dont think she consciously blames me but shes definitely frustrated.

The problem is magnified for me because I had some pretty bad mental health stuff going on during this time.
Mostly due to home circumstances but this work thing kind of put me over the edge. I ended up breaking down on a zoom call with her. After that I connected to my doctor and got the help I need but I have noticed that shes kind of avoiding me since then. Ive had another colleague comment that she seems dismissive of my ideas in team meetings. 

I recently sent her an email with some ideas of how we could improve our systems to prevent an incident from happening again and requested some training. She hasnt responded. But its only been a day- but I am obsessing! 

So i guess i have two issues- how do i not obsess over this, and what can i do to try to improve my image with her? advice welcome!

The not so simple answer is that we are humans and we are social creatures and want to be liked.

It will be impossible to not obsess over it in the back of your mind because you don't know where you stand with her.

I would encourage you to set up some time privately, in person, and share how you feel. In return, I would hope that she would be honest with you and reciprocate the dialogue. 

Best case scenario, it comes down to a misunderstanding and you can both chalk it up as a learning experience and move past. Worst case scenario, your boss shows you their cards and shares what they really think of you, and you can decide what your next step with the company will be.","1"

Supply chain would be more changing fields than growing on accounting degree. Its a really awarding field and has a great outlook. Globalization and the flow of products are still going to happen during ai taking over. You might have to start over on your level. 

Whereas with data analytics that heightens everything wgu has decision making specialization that might be worth it. You could leverage that to management and stick in your field or employer. Other schools are state schools usually have a program places liken Penn state. You can see how you like it first by getting the coursera data analytics cert or go with ecornell business analytics cert. ecornell has a great interface and I would highly recommend them. I got corporate communications and getting change management certs right now. 

Other options is systems engineering. Theres going to be a lot of complicated networks in the future. Go for cpa maybe take some qualifying classes for the hours. Like doubling down on accounting masters. Statistics its close to data analysis but actuary might be a good fit for you if you like math.","3"

Statistics is going to be in demand you can use it for data analytics but the big money maker is actuary. With climate change and heightened risks theres going to be more actuaries to factor insurance premiums and banks for lending purposes. Actuaries there are tests you take. Hospitals and research also need statistics grads. 

For actuary you can take a math class on udemy for $40. There is one that is preparing you for engineering math that will be a good pick. Its basically pre calculus and lower to spruce up. If you like that take calculus then enroll in masters of statistics.

Supply chain you also dont have to an entire degree you can study for cscp exam and cpsm and exam. You just buy around 2k books and materials and study for the exams. Take them and you have the certifications. You should be able to get a job with either one. There is also six sigma if you want to work for a company that makes stuff. Villanova has a certificate program where you go from yellow to black belt. Six sigma is basically the acceptable level of defects for quality control. Six per million. 

The other options is to go project management and program management If you like managing things and people. Thats an exam after 4 years of experience called the PMP. I was able to obtain this the test wasnt that hard. Theres an entire reddit community for tips and plenty of free videos online. To get experience and get in the field coursera has a project management cert from Google or there are masters in project management but that maybe overkill once you have pmp. I got my masters in project management from Georgetown and it was a good program but again its kinda of doesnt matter once you get the pmp certification.

"1124","2024-11-27",1732675099,"How do I navigate this situation?","TL;DR: High performer took promotion leading 20-person team but got stuck with toxic boss who provided zero training, violated medical privacy, and became hostile when called out (HR sided with OP) - now torn between staying in a role they love despite terrible leadership or risking career mobility by trying to transfer within company.

For some background, Im a high performer. Ive been promoted 4x in 10 years (at 3 diff companies). Most recently, Ive taken a promotion within my company to a different department. Its a new role that was created to support a struggling portfolio. 
Im leading a multinational team of 20 finance professionals, but this type of department is new to me. I believe I was hired for my ability to lead people and my strengths as a finance professional and process-proficient professional. 

My boss is unlike any leader Ive ever encountered. My training consisted of a 1 hour meeting (that I requested) my first week on the job.  I didnt know the systems, responsibilities, people and quite frankly, didnt know the industry that well as Id only been at the company a little over a year. Guidance/training wasnt given, nor were expectations of any kind. My boss and I rarely interact over the handful of months Ive been in the role, unless I initiate contact. 

I rolled my sleeves up and made a bunch of connections and solicited info from others within and outside of the department to figure out what the heck I was responsible for. It was an exhausting 6 months but figured it out (for the most part) and led my team to improvements month over month. Also trained new managers how to be good managers. Never received feedback of any sort from my leader (positive or critical), but receive tons of positive feedback from other leaders in the department as well as folks underneath me. 

Part of the story also includes the detail that i have a short-term medical accommodation (Dr note and HR/boss approved). This is recent (within the last 8 weeks and will last through mid-year next year). A few weeks after getting approval for this accommodation, boss told me I needed to disclose it to my team or he would. So I disclosed it. Hes also tied it to performance a couple times. 

Fast forward to a few weeks ago. My team/portfolios performance was better than that of my male peers (who has 10+ years experience on me and a simpler portfolio), but boss publicly and aggressively criticizes mine. I contact him privately and ask if he can share his criticism privately with me going forward instead of publicly, and he just gets  So aggressive, threatening and nasty (over Teams/email). I maintained respect and kindness despite his inappropriateness over several hours of messages. 

I end up reporting it all to HR - the violation of medical privacy, the hostility and poor treatment, a few other things as well. HR is very sympathetic, and tells my bosss boss within a few hrs of my complaint(s). When my boss finds out, retaliation begins and I report that as well to HR. 

HR investigation concluded in my favor (in regards to medical privacy, hostility, and retaliation). But now what? I have an awful leader, but I really love what I do (and I worked so hard to learn it). I have great connections within the company but worry he will black ball me if I try to interview next year within the company. FWIW, im highly charismatic and well-liked (he is not), Im 10 years younger than my peers and Im typically attractive (I dont think this should matter but Ive been told there have been comments made about my age and appearance). I also place a high level of importance on being a servant leader to my people, and have received feedback that my leadership is well received and has made changes in my teams learning and general well being. 

Im not worried my boss will continue to retaliate directly, because hes on thin ice with HR. But at the end of the day hes an awful people leader and I wont learn anything from him other than what not to do. Feeling stuck and hopeless.","careerguidance",0,"https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1h0tzue/how_do_i_navigate_this_situation/",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Thats a flex most people dont have. Instead of stretching yourself thin with extra classes, focus on *leveraging* what you already bring to the table. Like take a couple of targeted finance courses or certifications (think CFA Level 1 or Wall Street Prep), and start exploring internships or side projects in finance to get your foot in the door. The experience will matter way more than tacking on another major at this point.

If youre feeling like you missed the mark with marketing, its not the end of the world. Plenty of people pivot after graduation, and youre already ahead by realizing it now.

"1173","2024-11-27",1732673990,"Dealing with feelings of guilt over leaving a job?","So for starters I just started this job today. I get it, it's my first day and I'm not beholden to this role or the company so maybe I'm overreacting and getting mental over nothing. I started this role because I was getting laid off and I was offered this role in another  department. I work in IT, I joined up with another client to help support them in the region as an Audio Visual Tech and Desktop Support person.

I get a sense of guilt over the fact that I have met my manager and he seems like a good guy and that he has put a lot of faith in me in getting this role. We spent the day in the office and he travelled a few states away to meet me in person. I wouldn't feel this way if he was just some random person behind the screen that I never met but I have. I get the sense that they think I can do a lot of great work and put some faith in me to do it.

Perhaps I'm emotional over nothing but I really do feel this way and I'm not sure how to handle it. I was not thrilled with this job and took it as a stop gap until I get rehired at an old job that I worked at. I was laid off back in June due to financial reasons, there's been a managerial shift and my old boss says he wants me to come back pronto. I feel like the old role has greater opportunity for me, I got a lot more responsibility and felt like I was fulfilled more there and will grow more. The role I took is not something I really wanted nor was happy about, I took it because I was being laid off and didn't want to go on unemployment. 

No official offer has been made to me yet at the old job and I haven't talked to anyone at my current company about this. Assuming that this all works out, how would you handle that discussion. He's an adult man and it's a workplace so I don't really care about that but I do feel bad about feeling like I lead them on.","careerguidance",1,"https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1h0tmvt/dealing_with_feelings_of_guilt_over_leaving_a_job/","TogaTennis44","2024-11-27",1732675031,1,1,0,0,"For one, you sound like a seriously decent person for feeling guilt about this.

Put yourself in his shoes - I bet you wouldnt take it personally if roles were reversed and a new hire backed out on you. Sure, maybe inconvenienced. But not offended.

Did you struggle because you were bored/not putting the work in or was it genuinely difficult to grasp? 




&gt; The college program Im looking at requires precalculus and calculus which Im worried about. It also requires linear algebra which Im ok in but its just precalculus and calculus thats worrying me.




 




I want to be clear that linear algebra is the manipulation of matrices and vectors. Sometimes people who haven't taken it yet confuse it with algebra like from high school. 


 




Business analytics specifically may get away with less math, but analytics still requires serious statistical training. Eventually, you'll want Calc. I - Calc. III, linear algebra, probability, which is mostly applied calculus II, regression, which applies Calc. III and linear algebra. Calculus I is the easiest math class you are going to take on the way to statistical learning. This brings me to my advice. 


 






If your four-year degree requires a math class, and it probably does, declare in either and take Calc. I first semester. Apply yourself fully, read the relevant sections from the textbook rather than depending entirely on lectures. Try to understand what the calculations mean, rather than just how to perform them. If Calc. I is a real struggle, then stick with marketing or another business major. If Calc. I is a breeze, then go to a departmental advisor in statistics and ask for basic data science materials and evaluate.


 






Analytics isn't oversaturated, exactly, but it is an extremely competitive field. To be competitive for mid-career roles or entry-level roles at data-intensive companies, you will need a master's degree. A lot of places near me require or very loudly prefer PhDs. This is especially true for companies involved with AI tools. You should take that possibility into account as you decide which path to go down. 


 






 




Marketing might also require a mid-career MBA for progression, but I wouldn't know. You'd have to check that out. ","3"

Additionally, this was probably true for community college, but if you're struggling with a topic, get your ass in office hours.

"1193","2024-11-27",1732672925,"Should I shut down my business? ","Hey all! Im 29F, and I am thinking about heading back to a real job. 

I have a bachelors of science in secondary education, I taught high school for 4 years. During college, I worked as an office assistant for on campus and during summers. 

I quit teaching due to the lack of a work-life balance when I had my son in 2022, I was a nanny for about a year, and opened a bookkeeping business in early 2023. 

Ive had amazing months as a business owner, and Ive struggled a lot too. Im neurodivergent (I had lead poisoning as an infant) and the ups and downs are awful for my mental health. 

I really struggle with keeping clients (a few of them needed more than the basic bookkeeping I offer, I have a lot that just cancel when their business isnt going well) This year I put in a cancellation fee into my contract and raised my minimum price to $400/month and its been better but still not great.

I do have long-term clients but 2 of them their contact is up in December and I dont know if either of them will renew, putting me at below base-line for what I need to make to pay bills. The constant worry of the future and having no control if a client will sign a contract or not makes me sick to my stomach, I hyper fixate and spiral. 

I dont make enough consistently to hire help, and my husband doesnt want me to spend more on my business because we are saving for a house and anything I pay for for the business is money I could have put away for our future home. 

Part of me feels like if I do go get a job, I need to find one thats financially worth it. Right now, I only work part-time and my toddler is in daycare just 2 days a week. I bring home $3k after business expenses and taxes as of right now. In order to make it worth a full-time job and put my toddler in daycare full-time, I need a job making about 90k a year. 

I dont even know whats out there that I could do. I dont interview very well but Im truly a good person and hard worker - the thought of disappointing managers or coworkers terrifies me. 

Id appreciate thoughts, ideas, opinions. I feel burnt out, exhausted and lost. If youve read this far, thank you so much. I appreciate your time and compassion.

Either way I want to have a plan for a career when I get out, I plan to get all of the certifications I can get with my rate so I can possibly get a job working on airframes with Boeing or a similar company and as a back up I plan to attend the fire academy in my state and do firefighting/emt work which something I have been wanting to do I just feel it would be a waste to not use my current situation to my advantage knowing I can get certifications through the navy. Anyways with all of that out of the way I would love to eventually work for nasa or a similar company like SpaceX possibly doing airframes or other aircraft related jobs. My question is does anyone have advice on how I should go about doing this. Should I take advantage of the gi bill and go to school and get some sort of degree that would help me get a job in this industry or what should I do?

* I received a great job offer and have until Friday to decide
* I'm comfortable in my current role but am a contract to hire holding pattern (no PTO, sub-par benefits, etc.)
* There's a 75% chance I'll get a better offer from my current company, but odds of getting something in writing by Friday are slim to none

Recently i got accepted in med school, but after finding and researching more about it, i found out that it wasn't my biggest passion. My parents are doctors, so they celebrated and even gave me a cake when i entered, however, this all made me just cry, and finally rejected the vacant as i found that i had a big passion over veterinary medicine. 

When i said this to my parents, they started yelling at me that i will not reach anything at life and started every day insisting and trying to convince me to enter med school. But everytime they did that, my passion for medicine decreased more than before. On the other hand, vet school was passioning me alot and even tho i hadn't the support of my parents, i entered vet school too!

Now here is the part that is giving me the worst of anxietys, THE SALARIES AND WORK BALANCE. I have seen more than 30 videos of vets talking about their salaries in comparison of doctors, and the more i hear about it, the more anxious i get. I really love animals and i wish to help them, but i want to gain a great salary too, worth of a DOCTOR, as i basically get to study the same things and even more difficult than doctors, just to get so much less salaries than them, and this makes me sad, as i rejected the med school, but i don't want to go right now still. Obviously my parents did not even celebrated a single bit when i told them i entered vet school, so thanks to them i hate med school right now.

They are always telling me that they raised me to gain more money than them, not less, so i want to do this, but i will need to work so much harder to get this and even like this, it is not sure that i will be able to make it (my parents also told me that they are not willing to pay as much as they are willing to do for med school than for vet school btw). So what makes me anxious is that i have a much easier path as i can still ask to readquire that med school vacant as an option that the university gave me and i think ill possibly regain my passion for it as it is only because im mad at my parents.

I was a veterinary nurse for 10 years and was discouraged by most of the veterinarians I worked with when I was considering vet school. Their reasons being: Lots of student loan debt, comparibly low salaries starting out, terrible work-life balance, difficult pet owners. If you want to make money as a vet, go to a big city and be an emergency vet. Or do a residency in a big city and specialize in something like radiology, anesthesia, surgery, internal medicine. Know that you will be looking at another 4 years after graduating vetschool to do this, but from what I have seen-- the specialists make more money and seem a bit more satisfied with their careers. Emergency vet and primary care are difficult. Some owners are terrible and do not have the animal's best interest in mind and will prolong suffering. Some are angels and will go to the end of the world and back to do everything for their pet. There are a lot of reasons veterinary medicine has the highest rate of suicide of any health profession, atleast in the U.S. 

Human medicine is a safer bet, more money but also more schooling (unless you specialize in vet med). There is something to be said for your parents' willing to pay for your med school. Student loan debt can be crippling and take a lifetime to get out from under. 

I want to say to not worry about what your parents say and to go with your gut/passion. But there is definately a lot to consider.","2"

Figure out what denomination or tradition they are coming from and live the most extreme traditionalist version of it. Do your research, study your Bible, and start holding yourself and everyone who has the misfortune of working with you to impossible standards. Never get angry, but always call them out for the slightest misstep. Derail every discussion into a religious lesson no matter how tangential. Insist that every mundane decision be based on some biblical precedent no matter how obscure or tenuous. Condemn every innovation that might detract from perfecting one's faith. Lead every meeting with an eloquent but lengthy prayer that leaves little time for practical discussions. Attempt to proselytize everyone from outside the company that you deal with in the course of work. Lead Bible study during lunch breaks that always run long. Reframe the company's business model away from anything productive or profitable and towards serving Christ. 

You will either bankrupt them or break their faith.","4"

I would go to the meeting and find out more. The more information you have, the better you can decide your next steps. 

Find out what qualifications they have to address mental health. If participation is mandatory, you have some decisions to make. But if your mental health is fine, and you don't need a chaplain, sit down and direct the conversation. But assume it is not confidential. Might be a good chance to put in ear worms  can get up to red hat. 

You may have to decide which battles need to be fought if it's tramples human rights.

If they expect you to kneel or pray, obviously that's a different story...

Not sure what you expected working for a 'conservative, religious company' - for all you know, the chaplain wants to discuss how the current religious environment impacts business...

Assuming they're paying you for the 1:1 time with the chaplain, again, the question is what, exactly is the intent/agenda of these sessions.

It is a tough call these days - the whole Christian Nationalist mindset has newfound freedom with the election to push their agenda (bibles in schools, etc.).

It gets to be a grey line - companies have people come in and do ethics training and seminars on the company mission - if the company's mission incorporates religion and they pay you to listen without pressure to participate in religious practice....dunno...???","22"

If mandatory then sue, if voluntary then see if you can get them to admit in writing that participation in voluntary. But tbh, when people start pushing religion like this in private industry it is rarely voluntary and typically just the start. How much are you willing to put up with, what's your bandwidth for additional changes, and what are the other options in your area for job? These will likely all inform you when it comes to responding to this request.","23"

It doesnt place importance on any skin color or another. It also doesnt JUST involve skin color or sexual orientation. All Disabilities, abilities, ethnicities, etcs are discussed and included or should be. 

DEI isnt about hiring a certain person over another. But about looking at those two people for who they are as individuals and not what your presumed bias is against them. It is about overcoming the use of micro aggressions towards people who have a different background than you.  Theres a lot more to it and i would be happy to share resources with you.

DEI doesnt advocate for that either.

My company does outreach events in low income (and sometimes that means a high percentage of Black, Indigenous, and Latino students, sometimes it happens to be predominantly White) areas to do presentations on what engineering jobs can look like. This is because most of these students do not have parents that have a white collar background and are unfamiliar with what white collar jobs look like day in and day out. We also help interested students with college admissions guidance, as again, these students do not have parents familiar with the process. That is what DEI is. Just because you dont understand it, does not make it wrong.

Do you know what equity is? A high income student will live in an area with good schools with an excess of extracurriculars, with access to SAT/ACT prep that if not free, can be paid for by their parents, and their parents have likely completed higher education. Equity is giving those same resources to underprivileged people who dont know that they exist or cant afford them, so that they have the same shot at opportunities.

And finally, doing a mandatory module on how all people should be respected regardless of their background isnt equivalent to (presumably) forcing employees to sit with a religious figure (regardless of if they practice that religion) one on one that has 0 legal obligation to keep their conversations private. If employees share a faith and want to form their own group, theres nothing wrong with that. It becomes wrong when they want to force people to join their religion. DEI is not a religion or a belief, its typically a company policy that sums up to: respect each other.","41_2_1_1"

Currently, I work in a municipality. It's an entry-level job and I know it won't be my forever gig but it's good for what I need right now. It's not my passion but I like my coworkers and can do my daily tasks and I consider myself good at my job. 

Lately, I've been struggling. Because I work for a municipality, me and my frontline coworkers get all the grief from the town. Whether it's a decision made by the mayor and council or an issue completely related to a different department, we are treated like we are personally responsible. People also act like we make bank which absolutely isn't true. 

Until now I've been managing just fine but I find it's getting to me. My managers never tell me ""good job"" or ""thanks"" and the public acts like I'm a millionaire who personally runs the city. I understand times are tough and people are frustrated but I'm beginning to feel dragged down. I also feel that people are ruder post-COVID. I do try to go above and beyond in my job to help people but lately I feel like I'm just getting meaner and losing my ability to care. People are also acting like stuff I literally can't do because of policy is a personal slight against them and a giant conspiracy that I'm engineering on behalf of the municipality and I know that happens in a lot of jobs but it's weighing on me. 

How do you work a thankless job? I like to think I have thick skin and I do have a life outside of work that I enjoy but this is my first ""adult"" job and I think I'm still learning how to navigate this part of having a career. I don't mind going to work but I hate feeling beaten down after I come home.

"1335","2024-11-27",1732669295,"Put on PIP today, what next?","Hi everyone,

I need some career advice after being put on a PIP today. For context I graduated with a Master's in Accounting back in 2021 then started my career at PwC as a trust and estate tax associate and quickly realized if I stayed I would be pigeonholing myself as this is a super niche sector of tax. After a touch over a year at PwC I found a new opportunity at Deloitte as a Private Equity tax associate thinking this would be a good stepping stone role to learn the Private Equity industry as I realized I wanted to work in finance. Well after 1.5 years at Deloitte I was laid off as my team was downsizing, my group was fairly large and budgets for engagements were tightening. I was never put on a PIP or anything while at Deloitte. It was purely a last in first out deal. During the time I was laid off I was offered numerous tax roles that I declined as I still wanted to break into finance. About a month after being laid off I finally found a role that focused on business valuation at a litigation services firm, not entirely what I wanted to do (all of our clients are going through a divorce and we value clients business as part of the divorce proceedings) but the only finance job that did not tell me 'well you only have tax experience' so respectfully no. Well I have been in this current role for about 9 months now and I have been put on a PIP. I am completely lost on how to continue my career. I fully think I will be able to 'meet expectations' for the PIP but also understand that PIPs are the corporate way of saying get ready to be fired. I'm going to immediately start looking for new jobs but do not know how to handle this current role. Do I include a job I was only at for roughly 9-11 months (including the time I will be on the PIP) as it is the only finance relevant experience I could show? Do I omit the experience completely and tell future employers I took the time since I left Deloitte to focus on personal growth, travel, re-define my career, etc. etc? Do I start looking into MBA programs? I'm 26 and still early into my career. I'm also not trying to appear as a job hopper as I was only at PwC for 1 year and Deloitte for 1.5 years and this job for under a year.

I need some career advice after being put on a PIP today. For context I graduated with a Master's in Accounting back in 2021 then started my career at PwC as a trust and estate tax associate and quickly realized if I stayed I would be pigeonholing myself as this is a super niche sector of tax. After a touch over a year at PwC I found a new opportunity at Deloitte as a Private Equity tax associate thinking this would be a good stepping stone role to learn the Private Equity industry as I realized I wanted to work in finance. Well after 1.5 years at Deloitte I was laid off as my team was downsizing, my group was fairly large and budgets for engagements were tightening. I was never put on a PIP or anything while at Deloitte. It was purely a last in first out deal. During the time I was laid off I was offered numerous tax roles that I declined as I still wanted to break into finance. About a month after being laid off I finally found a role that focused on business valuation at a litigation services firm, not entirely what I wanted to do (all of our clients are going through a divorce and we value clients business as part of the divorce proceedings) but the only finance job that did not tell me 'well you only have tax experience' so respectfully no. Well I have been in this current role for about 9 months now and I have been put on a PIP. I am completely lost on how to continue my career. I fully think I will be able to 'meet expectations' for the PIP but also understand that PIPs are the corporate way of saying get ready to be fired. I'm going to immediately start looking for new jobs but do not know how to handle this current role. Do I include a job I was only at for roughly 9-11 months (including the time I will be on the PIP) as it is the only finance relevant experience I could show? Do I omit the experience completely and tell future employers I took the time since I left Deloitte to focus on personal growth, travel, re-define my career, etc. etc? Do I start looking into MBA programs? I'm 26 and still early into my career. I'm also not trying to appear as a job hopper as I was only at PwC for 1 year and Deloitte for 1.5 years and this job for under a year. Looking back I completely regret leaving PwC and should have stayed but made each career move trying to set myself up in an industry I want to pursue.

I don't know if this is an appropriate thing to ask here, but I work as a repair technician for a school district and am looking for career advancement in tech. 

I got my bachelors degree in Psychology, hated every job I had after college and decided to transition to Tech in my later 20's. 

I have been eyeing careers in cloud security, and have interest in AWS careers such as becoming a solutions architect. 

In preparation I have purchased online courses in Python &amp; AWS Cloud Practitioner. I've been having a blast with Python, previously being put off by other programming languages like C++ or Java. I have no related work experience programming, nor is my college degree in the tech field (worthless waste of $$$). 

I have completed a cybersecurity boot-camp, but have no certifications yet. 

At the age of 31, do I realistically have career opportunities granted I put the work in, become proficient in a coding language, and earn a number of related certifications?

Although I have none of those, I'm still pretty skilled at some things. And so what I'm asking is for people who are older than 20 and have already found a job and are happy with it.

A skill that has been often pointed out to me by my English teachers is my use of language and level of speaking for my age and situation, me being so young,and English being my third of four languages. I have been told numerous times that my writing skills, especially in essays and reviews, are impressing, and I realize I actually don't quite hate writing, which led me to wonder if I could pursue a career which requires from me something of great similarity to what I have just described. I will mention that although my writing has been described as good, my creativity is not nearly as good. Now for my second skill, I have been told I can word out sentences pretty well and am quite good at explaining complex ideas and concepts to those who are not quite as knowledgeable, though I must mention that I am far from a social person, and would rather labour in a rather introverted workplace. Another skill that I have personally observed in myself is that I'm quite good at following rules or methods and applying them to whatever I am doing, I contradiction to creating my own principles or ideas. 

I would prefer a work environment in which I don't usually encounter many people, but am not totally against the idea of having to socialize from time to time with my coworkers. I would really love a job that will be stress-free, or at least not very stressful, that will allow me to have flexible hours and be able to also take part in activities that interest me outside of my job. I would very much like to not have to create or come up with anything, for, as I already stated, I am nothing for any spect of creativeness, and would much rather apply an already existent method to different forms of it. That pretty much sums up my preferences

My future intentions are to live a comfortable life, not necessarily luxury, in a small apartment all to myself and the most efficient form of transportation. I will likely be living in a cold place (DEFINITELY NOT USA) for I intend to ski most of my free time, where taxes are not too high and there's a somewhat high demand or opportunities for jobs. I suppose I won't own any pets or have a partner, which I assume makes everything a little more simple, although this is not for sure.

Please let me know which career I will most likely tolerate to pursue and will still have free time to myself, with an average or higher salary. Keep in mind that I'm open to anything that might suit me, even if it doesn't consider ALL of the things which I have mentioned on here

Help would be appreciated!

For some background I graduated college about a year ago and have been working since then. I am currently in a IT rotational program where most of my focus will be in the analytics space (data science, data engineering, data viz). I am currently on rotation one and would have the opportunity for two more rotations after this. 

After being reached out to on LinkedIn about a new job, I decided to interview and just found out I got an offer. This new role is a data analyst role, with a large focus on data engineering (so probably a less wide variety of experience compared to my rotational program). This offer is at a company which is a similar size (probably a bit more recognizable) than my current one. During my interviews I did like the people I interviewed with, but was a bit concerned that I would not get as broad of work experience as I get currently. It sounds from my interviews that WLB would be the same, and both roles are hybrid with similar amount of time in office.

With this, I am unsure if I should take the offer. I am really enjoying my time in my current role, and like the company I work for. What makes it tough is that this new offer would have about a 35% higher salary than what I currently make with relatively similar benefits (5 less pto days which is a bummer). I make a decent amount of money currently, but the 35% jump is hard not to look at. I am trying to figure out which would be more beneficial for me in the long run, to stick out my current program at a company I like and get more breadth of experience while making less money, or to dive into a specific role at a new company while making more money.

Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks!

Long story short, we are having a tough time sufficiently describing their experience and I believe it is costing them the opportunity for interviews.

Background: My partner works at a small company (4 locations about 350 employees). My partner has a very intense work ethic and this was recognized by the CFO. My partner started as a receptionist, but they were then paid (by the CFO) to obtain an accounts payable certification. After achieving the certification, they were then trained to assume the role of accounts payable manager/coordinator. This has been their position for just over a year now. They manage the accounts payable pipeline for all of the locations. They handle communication with vendors, payment prioritization, employee expenses, you name it. Because of the size of the company, my partner handles a wide array of tasks that would usually be outside the scope of an entry level AP/AR type role. My partner loves this work, and would very much like to continue in this area (but we are moving).

The problem is that we do not know the best way to articulate this experience.  I believe my partner is quickly being dismissed by potential employers based on the length of the experience. Specifically, for positions that have listed responsibilities that are far fewer than their current role, and much narrower in scope. Im wondering if there is any way to get around this. Perhaps I am being unrealistic and the experience is just the experience (simple as that), but it really feels like if my partner was able to at least get interviews they would have a chance to display their depth. Also, upper management has gone out of their way to draft letters of recommendation, and they have been vocal about being willing to speak with potential employers.

I got the feeling that a lot of companies were waiting until the election to make any hiring decisions, and now after the election I've interviewed with a few more companies, but we're now getting into the holidays/end of the year, which, from my experience, companies typically will defer until the beginning of the year to hire or start someone new - at least in positions that i've been in. 

About a month after being laid off there was a smaller company I interviewed with several times, even talking with the CEO directly. Following my final interview with this company, I didn't hear back from them in over a week &amp; just assumed I was being ghosted. However, after a final follow up with the CEO he called me &amp; basically explained that they really liked me and wanted me on the team, however the company just really wasn't in a place to take on another employee at the time like they had thought &amp; didn't know when they would be (a month, a year, etc"") He did say that they would love for me to still consider them in the future, however. While, I know some may say they were just trying to let me down easy - &amp; that may be true - I do believe him because he also passed my name and resume along to two colleagues of his who were also CEOs of other similar companies, which he didn't have to do at all. I did reach out to his colleagues &amp; they both confirmed that he did reach out to them, however neither of them were currently making any hires at the moment either (again, all of this was prior to the recent presidential election).

I am absolutely sick of this industry. It has completely destroyed my soul, and the worst part are basically the consumers. There is nothing fulfilling about it anymore.

It was a massive rug pull in the sense that I went from working enterprise digital marketing, to being in full sales, cold calling mom and pop shops for this massive retailer trying to build up ecommerce. A LOT of details about the role were completely omitted when I interviewed, the management was insanely toxic, but it was ""easy"" to an extent, I did the minimum but always hit quota. Manager was the worst I've ever worked with though, so I was getting berated constantly about how I didn't ""have it"" in his opinion based on zero data. 

Not only that, but 6 months into the role they added new constraints to our ability to earn bonus and also yanked back 22% of our base salary. One guy who started the day they announced that, agreed to 1 base salary on a Friday, and that Monday learned it was actually going to be 22% lower.

Long story short, I pivoted internally to get away from him, the pay is a bit lower without the bonuses, but this role is much easier. Easy in the sense that its pure task work. I get emails, I relay those into tickets. I do a report once a week, and I take notes on calls. There's some nuance, sometimes I have to keep a lot of stuff moving along. But you could train anyone to do this, its not hard, and its also not at all interesting. I honestly don't really see a path where I can stay and grow within this org. Especially no way for me to utilize the 12 years of experience I have, here.  

Which begs the question. Is it even worth me going above and beyond, doing as much as I can to be perfect, on top of everything, being that grinder that's up early, on late, and taking on extra?

I dont mind doing the paperwork and hanging the kids artwork on display bc it gives me time to escape (sometimes I just need a break from being around the kids). And lastly, Im over the long hours of poor pay. I do 25 hours a week bc its term time in a nursery and the pay is atrocious. The amount we put in day to day for these kids to be paid a few cashew nuts is crazy. I dont think I can see myself doing this for another 3 more years. Its not feasible and Im also no longer interested in the nursery life of 2-4 year olds. Sorry if Im venting but this is helping me get out all of the feelings of why I need to leave by next year.

I enjoyed my time in university and focused on process modelling, simulation and the connection between AI and chemistry, but at the end of my master's I was fed up with studying and decided against a PhD. In hindsight I probably had a burn-out. 
Since then, I worked at a relative's business in IT, programming multiple solutions to streamline processes and improve overall efficiency. 
Afterwards, I started at a start-up in sustainable chemistry space, since founding a company has always intrigued me.

So far, I have designed and implemented software for real-time communication between scientific hardware and a PLC, including coding the PLC part and a user interface for it all. I then used the data gathered by the scientific hardware to monitor process stability, which is not done yet and have made several discoveries about the process behaviour and parameter influence on process performance.

I feel as though having a degree would be helpful in earning a higher salary, but I am stuck on what degree to pursue. I have 60+ credits, most are from working toward an associate Visual Communication Graphic Design degree.  I realized was the wrong path for me and quit a few classes short of the degree nearly 20 years ago. 

I was working part time during school and hired on full time before I'd have finished my degree. I remained with that employer for 15 years. I learned much about running an office for a small business (20-30 employees) related to wholesale sales &amp; distribution from a mid sized warehouse of imported products. Specifically, I did design for print &amp; web, was the company 'IT' person , backed up sales, CS, AR, AP &amp; assisted the GM with inventory management (&amp; data cleaning). I was(am) always looking for ways to make improvements. I left because we never had annual reviews and only got raises if we asked for them, which I was really uncomfortable doing. It took me a long time to realize how much I was screwing myself, salary wise. I left that company for a CORP job. Now I get regular cost of living raises, but I am stuck in my current narrow lane position and I am struggling to get out. I think having a degree would help, but which one?

I lean toward IT, but I don't think I have enough interest to beat the competition when it comes to Computer Science related jobs. I do like data &amp; building reports &amp; dashboards.

I (27f) have a BS in Biology, while in school got good grades, did research and extracurricular work in science and natural history education.

"1386","2024-11-27",1732737718,"What would you do if you were in my shoes?","Long post. Feel free to read, or not, I just needed to vent a bit.

I guess I come here looking for advice. Or discussion, if anyone wants to share anything about their own journey.

I'm a 25M, I know that I'm still really young and that the best is yet to come. I am learning to trust that, but still.

A little bit about me and what I did in school :

After high school (where I'd say I was an average student, I didn't fail any classes but also didn't have the best grades of my class), I went to nursing school. My mom is a nurse, I am really good with people, and I thought it made sense for me. After it began, I saw my closest friends in their calculus &amp; physics classes and I thought ""oh no yeah that's way easier to work with"". I guess my brain works well with maths. So I did a pure / applied Science degree before going into electrical engineering.

I decided to go into electrical engineering in a heartbeat. Not because it was what I wanted to do, but because I felt that I just needed to choose something and maybe rushed that decision. I did 5 semesters, 2 internships, before Covid hit, broke up with my girlfriend of 5 years, lost her, my cats, my bed, had to move out, maybe an undiagnosed depression? Idk, just a hard time and decided to drop out of engineering school.

I took a little bit less than a year to be with myself, figure stuff out. At the end of that year, I went back to what I thought was right for me from the beginning, working with people. I absolutely love being around people, share with them, help when I can, learn how they think, share how I think, etc. So I went back to school, this time to be a social worker.

And wouldn't you know it, I missed math. I guess I'm a nerd idk. Just like nursing school, I didn't stay for a whole semester before saying to myself that I work better with objective equations and numbers, instead of theories and something as complicated as the human psyche. So I dropped out and went into computer science the very next semester.

It's now been 2 and a half years since I began CS. And this time, everything is easy. Top of my class, honor mentions, whatever you could think of. I've had people tell me that I'm really smart. I guess I am, but the truth is, I realize that school teaches me how to take tests, and with time I've become really good at it.

Right now, my second internship in computer science is coming to an end. And you know what I'm realizing? Ain't no fucking way. I just can't sit in front of a computer all day. I need to be with other people who also want to be with other people. I need something real, not work to increase shareholder value for some big company. I need to be active. I need to talk. I've jokingly said (or not so jokingly) that after my CS degree I'll start working in a bakery. 

Of course, a CS degree most of the time means a higher paying job. But I'm in a good situation and I also do not spend a whole lot of money. I am fortunate enough to not have debts to pay. So I don't care about a 6 figures job. It sucks the soul out of me (as I felt in my last 4 internships, engineering and CS combined) and it's just not worth it.

I just feel like I want my cake and eat it too. I feel like I'm unrealistic in my job expectations.

Right now, I'm leaning towards teaching. I understand the classes well enough and I am already a tutor in my university. But would anyone want a teacher that has no ""real world experience"" in the job market?

I know that nothing is lost. Everything I did you until now will come back to help me someday. But I just feel lost, and a bit afraid (as most people do in their mod twenties I guess). 

If you're older than me and recognized yourself in what I wrote, I would absolutely love to hear from you, your decisions, how life has been treating you through it.

If no one sees this, well so be it, writing this still helped my organize my thoughts.

I had worked for my previous employer for over a decade and adored the work and work environment. The main reasons I left was due to lack of advancement in my current role as a manager and a significant increase in salary in the new job. I reached out to my previous employer and it looks like they have developed a new director level role that I would absolutely love to do (and comes with a similar wage to my current role) - so I applied. I have been informed that they would like to offer me the position, and I should receive it any day now. Once I get/negotiate/accept this, I will likely have the option to give 2 weeks notice (working days) before the holidays at the beginning of Dec or wait until the beginning of January. The risk in giving my notice in Dec is that I may not get my paid stat holidays in Dec (and insurance coverage for week long vacation I am taking). But my boss will be gone on vacation for the latter part of the month and there will be less interaction with them. If I wait until January, I potentially open myself up to two weeks of hell as I feel like they will not take my departure well, as there is a lot of work upcoming. I worry I'd be thinking about this over my holidays. There should be some flexibility in starting the new role - either at the beginning of the new year or middle of the month.

"1392","2024-11-27",1732735338,"How can I transition into HR from my niche position?","For the last 10 years i've worked for a very small consulting and investigative firm. I've performed a variety of roles at this company, but ultimately I am the closest thing to an HR manager that we have. It's a task I share with 2-3 other managers. We don't have benefits and we outsource payroll to a small accounting firm.

I interview and onboard/train all new hires. I handle the compliance, the contracts, the credentials, con-ed etc.

This all also bleeds over into my ""main"" job which is essentially ensuring all of our hardware, software, and data storage/security/retrieval meets the needs of the company as a whole. So i'm also the IT manager charged with evaluating workflow making sure we stay elastic.

When i'm not doing either of those things - I assist everyone else with investigations and consulting (often as third party HR). More often than not, this is more HR work than my internal duties, as we don't hire often. Mediation, workplace investigations, interviews, conduct etc.

I had one interview for a large metropolitan city high-level HR job (I would be fine with mid-level), but I could feel the energy leave the room once I mentioned ""small business"", it also didn't help that it was my first interview in **many** years despite preperation. I also have very little experience with the application of workplace laws, ADA (which was in the interview), benefits, and HRIS systems. We use a hybrid case/personnel mgmt service that is more suited to our industry. Since that interview a couple months ago, it's been crickets despite more applications in more places. I know some HR positions deal with payroll/benefits, some don't. Some are more analytical and focused on improving metrics, and some more micro-focused.

I don't want to work in tech or cybersecurity. HR feels a little more natural to me, so that's what i'm working towards, but it's tough to break out of small business and even tougher to break out as a ""jack of all trades"" employee. My bachelors was in Industrial/Organizational Psyc many moons ago.

What are some ""hard qualifications"" I can put to paper that might help me get out of this pit? I'm already looking into some Workday Coursera training, which seems to be one of the more popular systems today. Would getting a PHR certification help (I do it see it on most applications)? I know certifications in IT can hit or miss, i've already been down that road.  Can I become acquainted with workplace/benefits/OSHA laws on my own? Is there a way to demonstrate that?

I'm expecting an offer from 2 companies any day now as per conversations with HR and I'm in the process of a couple more. So here's my situation summary.

**Company A (Senior Data analyst) (Tableau - SQL for internal decision making)**

A local startup that's only been running for 5 years or so which is probably risky. It has no mentor to learn from but offers a senior title (the next logical step in my career now) and a 56.3% higher net salary than Company B (and 10% higher than my most recent job). However, having no one mentor/technical manager IMO is a huge downside and from the looks of it, the work-life balance + very long commute would also be terrible which might affect my side hustles.

**Company B (Data Analyst): (Web Analytics Consultancy role using company product)**

A multinational late-stage startup with a great product, culture, work-life balance, and perks but a significantly lower salary. I think it's because they don't hire seniors and aim to hire and then promote. For context, the hiring manager has the same experience as me and we're the same age but she's been with the company for 4 years and got promoted internally. I've passed their assessments with flying colors and the feedback was extremely good from what the HR at every single step.

**My thoughts**

If it wasn't for the salary, company B would've been a no-brainer but I'm not sure if I can negotiate my way into a higher salary as the HR kept emphasizing the salary amount every fucking step. They are offshoring this role to a lower salary market but they are taking it to an extreme level and it's redeculous to work within a team from Europe and USA and consult the same US clients and get 1/10 of their salary doing the same work.

I took my latest job because I had nothing else at the time and I knew I wouldn't last long. I don't want to keep job-hopping every couple of months as it would look terrible on my CV but I don't want to stay jobless.

**What would be the best way to approach this?**

1. Should I try to aggressively negotiate with B as I know I'm worth more even though they said they don't have much room for negotiation?
2. Should I just get in and try to negotiate or leave once I land a better job even though it would look worse on my CV?
3. Should I just refuse both as I have enough income to get by from my side hustles and just wait for a better opportunity?
4. Try my luck with company A even though I think it's a loss of time with the only advantage being the salary.","careerguidance",0,"https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1h1bcdo/should_i_take_a_job_even_though_i_know_its_not/",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"1405","2024-11-27",1732732301,"I dont know if Im happy in my job. Is the job or am I being too sensitive? ","I 22(f) started in a job working in an opticians three months ago. I have actually enjoyed the job and find the work really fulfilling. My job entails preparing people for their eye tests, helping them pick out glasses and assisting in processing orders etc. 

However, this is the first time Ive felt like I havent got on well in a work environment. The job itself isnt hard but there are a lot of small details that can be hard to remember since I havent had too much practice at it yet. I feel like Im asking my colleagues for help or asking them questions a lot as I want to be sure that what Im doing is correct. However every time I ask a colleague for help its like I can feel them rolling their eyes at me. 

I feel really miserable when I ask my colleagues a question and when something comes up that I need that extra bit of help with, Im filled with dread knowing I have to ask for help. 

I am only in the job three months so I feel like it should be okay for me to ask questions and get help as its the only way to learn. When I dont ask for help and I make a mistake there is always such a big deal made out of things. I feel like if I ask for help, I am made to feel stupid or like a nuisance or if I dont ask for help and I make a mistake Im made to feel stupid for it anyway. 

For example, today a girl came in to pick up her contact lenses. I pulled out the lenses and had a look at her file, I noticed that the lenses werent correct so I asked my colleague what the story was, just double checking to see if these contact lenses were actually for her. My colleague said that they werent right and to give her the other type of contact and ask the customer to pay the difference.

I did exactly that and when I was finished with the transaction my colleague told me that I didnt do the exchange correctly, making me feel so stupid for doing the wrong thing. I left work crying because even though I did what I thought was the right thing, Im still being made to feel stupid for not doing it right. 

I feel like this is the first place I have worked in where I feel like I have no friends in the job. Its really making me question myself as a person and I have spent nights crying wondering is there something wrong with me that my colleagues dont seem to like me very much. 

Am I just being over sensitive? Should I just grow up a little and get on with the job? Or do I have a genuine reason for feeling like my colleagues dont like me?

Ive been thinking about something Im calling Skill Shift Advantagewhen someone takes a rare, highly valued skill from one field and uses it to dominate in another where that skill isnt taught.

For example, my old boss started in emergency management, working with police and fire departments. He learned how to command attention and navigate authority. Then he switched to finance, where no one had those skills, and suddenly, he was miles ahead of everyone else.

Its not just about transferring skillsits about bringing something uncommon and valuable to a place where it gives you a serious edge. But it seems risky too. Youre betting the skill will still be valuable by the time you make your move.

So, have you seen this happen before? Is this a widely understood concept or something no one really talks about? And do you think its possible to predict whether a skill will pay off in a new fieldor is it just a gamble?

I (25m) have come to realize I do not handle work stress well. Stress and fear of being reprimanded is pretty much the sole thing that keeps me getting stuff done. I enjoy praise and it motivates me but Im currently new in my position and things I feel proud about accomplishing are just considered the norm. Every day I fear Im not doing enough or Im doing something wrong. It helps me stay on task but there are so many times Ive missed something or done something wrong and it makes me spiral in a stressed out depressive state. 

I work in a management position. I have to constantly keep up with schedules and budgets for very large land projects and provide weekly updates. I give presentations to operations and sales teams. I give overviews for marketing and production teams. And I often feel I come up short on managing my projects and knowing about them well enough. 

My last job that I left a couple months ago, I felt the exact same thing daily. I was doing well in my last job but I swear it took everything out of me to do so. Constantly stressing and worrying. I really feel like I may not be cut out for the amount of responsibility I assume in my past and current position. I always felt like project management was the only way to make enough money. And now that I make over six figures and have a kid on the way it feels like Im stuck doing this bc I cant afford to make less. My wife wants to quit her job to take care of the baby. And I might just have to suck it up and live w the stress. 

I dont know if this is burnout but I really have lost confidence that Im cut out to be a manager. I feel like a young, dumb kid. Im not very organized and I wing it a lot. I dont think those are traits of a good manager. I really dont know what else I can do though. I have a good amount of construction knowledge but not enough to start a business or run a crew.

The pay is $550 dollars per month. I stay in Qatar so for an intern to get that much it's a huge deal as here interns don't get any salary. Very few companies provide salaries to intern. 

I got hired as a a Junior Business Analyst intern and I got hints that they are planning to hire me full time as my Project Manager said she would be involving me into a large project.  She also trusted me enough to talk to a client for another project plus I am the only BA who is working with her for one more project. I am mostly testing and adding bugs to JIRA and following up with the developers. Sometimes I got the task to make user guides or update BRD. 

I originally planned to become a software developer upon graduation as I graduated with a information systems degree and I also like coding. I told my PM and also the HR that I have a passion in coding so I would like to shift to backend development field. The HR told me they will make me do the internship training again for the backend developer position if I get selected after the interview. Also the teams they have in the company are either .NET Developer, Laravel, or Drupal. Mobile app development is done from their branch in India and I can't go there. I have a passion for mobile app development but I'm not sure if they would let me work from here so for now my only options are .NET, Laravel or Drupal in which I have no experience nor passion in. 

My question is, do I stay in the BA field or do I take the risk and move to Laravel or Drupal as I'm definitely not interested in .NET. 

Also if I stay in BA field for let's say 6 months, can I shift to a software development field later on or will I be stuck in the BA field. Honestly I don't enjoy the work much but it's fine. My only worry is that when I get hired full time, I will get multiple projects to handle and a lot of workload including working overtime (from home as well after coming back from office?) sometimes when projects are nearing due date.

The other offer is basically my dream job in a city 2-3 hours away from me. I've been to the city once before and got a nice vibe, but know basically no one there, and only had one round of interviews, so don't feel like I know the team that well either (though they made a great first impression). I am having a really hard time turning this offer down as I was not expecting to find something so aligned with my interests and values so quickly after post-grad, but really struggle when I don't have a robust social network, and am honestly not sure I have the energy to move and find a place on a dime (I'd need to be there mid-December). I also recently was the victim of a very traumatic crime which makes me nervous about being in a new city alone. Seems like I'd be putting a lot on the line for this job if I did take it!

"1426","2024-11-27",1732725358,"22M, Studying Law in Spain, Which Path Should I Take?","hi everyone! I'm a 22 year old male, dual US and EU citizen, studying law in Madrid, a bit lost and looking for advice. I speak both English and Spanish natively, as well as B1 level French and Catalan.

I'm originally from the US and began studying Computer Science at university in 2020. I hated it and really struggled with the lockdown and online classes (I have ADHD). I wanted a change in life and was able to obtain citizenship in a EU country by ancestry and moved to Spain in early 2023. I taught English in Barcelona for a year which was ok, but I was accepted to study a Bachelor's in Law in Madrid and this is my first semester. I like Madrid a lot better than Barcelona so I'm glad I moved here but I feel a bit lost.

I'm in my first year of a four year program. In order to practice law I would need to complete a one year masters in law as well. I chose law because I've always been a social studies guy, I really liked history and related subjects at school. But unlike in the US, law is an extremely popular undergrad and accessible degree in Spain. Maybe it could be compared to Poli Sci in the US, but there's sooo many law undergrad students in Spain. It's pretty competitive to get a good job and starting salaries for junior lawyers arent that impressive either. My university is known to be prestigious and many of my classmates talk about wanting to work at fancy Spanish law firms but it doesn't resonate with me. I see myself either doing some kind of ""international"" job or opening my own business maybe, I really don't know. I'd like to do something creative but profitable like flipping houses or some kind of investment.

I'm almost 23 and It feels a bit disheartening to imagine studying 4 years for an undergrad, 1 years for a master and starting off for a few years at job that doesn't pay well. Im privileged because I pay local tuition and my parents help support me, but Id like to be able to stand on my own two feet and pay my bills before I'm 27 haha. Since thats how long it would take me to do finish the masters in law.

I'm not sure if this is the best way to progress my career or if it would be better to do a Grado Superior (2 year technical degree Formacion Profesional) in something like Finance, Accounting and Sales. Or if I should study part time and work in something to try and gain experience while studying.

Another issue I think I have is that I really don't like my university. I study at University Carlos III, the law program here is extremely preppy and privileged. I'm the only non Spanish person and I haven't really made any friends in my program, my social life is completely separated from my studies. Ideally I'd prefer to study at the Universidad Complutense since it's a larger more diverse and laid back school, but a lot of people tell me the internship and job opportunities are better for students at my uni.

At the same time, my dad told me law can be a good degree if you want to start your own business since you know the system well, which is true but I'm just not sure which path to take and which goals I should set for myself. I really like living in Madrid &amp; Europe but maybe there's a way I could leverage my dual citizenship and cultural background to achieve success.

I've been reading Richard Kiyosaki's book Rich Dad Poor Dad. Id like to study and continue to educate myself, but I want to prioritize things that will help me achieve financial freedom and a meaningful career

Id appreciate any advice. Have a nice afternoon.

I was formerly a talent acquisition specialist at a global pharmaceutical company for the better part of 3.5 years. I had a very high base salary out of college (product of the pandemic, I presume) and pretty much cruised until I was let go earlier this year.

Now, I'm in a tech SDR job to try out sales, making nearly half of my previous salary. I got promoted in my third month, but am already starting to feel burnt out and underpaid around 7 months in. I've got a degree from a highly accredited university. I try applying to Account Executive or Account Manager roles in HR/Recruiting software, but have been rejected over 50 times in the last two months. My confidence is absolutely shot, and every day I'm swarmed with doubts and fears that I had it too easy during the pandemic with my cushy remote job and salary. I wonder if my expectations were set too high for what work should look like, and for what pay I can expect as a 2021 grad. 

Am I wrong to think I can parlay my 3.5 years of recruiting into a better sales job? Is the market bad right now for doing such?

I have an idea of where I want to be, but I am just at a loss on how to move forward. I have been researching a pathway into tech and it's hard to know what to do first.

Some people say getting CompTia A+ but then some people say that's useless now, and to go for the Sec+ or Network+. I would be willing to get my computer science degree and I was thinking of doing it through Western Governors University. I don't know if it would hold the weight I want from it. I've thought about doing AWS certifications and moving into cloud computing that way. There are so many grifters on youtube. I don't know what's real.

Honestly, I want to be in a field that I can advance or at least make a living wage.

I have also thought about going into a trade (either welding, an electrician or getting my CDL.) The unions here rarely take applications and I'm not sure how to move forward with that. I have thought about going to community college for welding or to get my CDL, but inclement weather and other lame drivers are a big deterrent for my CDL. Mainly I like to work alone.

**My background:** I have a Bachelor in Design, specialising in Visual Communication and Branding, with 3 years of work experience in advertising and design, plus an additional 3 years of freelance experience in India. I left my job to build and establish my identity as an independent artist and creator on social media. So far I've done reasonably well, having collaborated with several large brands for their creative campaigns as an independent artist and building a following of over 150K on Instagram through my illustrations, animations, and comics.

I've always wanted to study further, but right now it seems like time is running out. Also, deciding on the right course is of course a challenging affair, especially since I have limited financial support and can't afford the freedom to experiment with multiple Masters programs.

I havent found the right mentors to guide me on the best courses or universities to consider. Im fairly certain that I dont want to pursue further specialisations in design, so Ive been exploring **Media and Communications** programs at various universities.

Currently, Im enjoying a comfortable freelance life and being approached for exciting projects through my networkwhich I'm not sure I want to leave behind. A faculty member from my college suggested looking at **fellowships** instead of a Masters program, as they might give me the opportunity to study abroad and gain international experience but I am not sure how and where to find suitable options for this.

They seemed like a fast-moving team, so it may be likely their needs might change in the future.

I am hesitant to pitch, because I do not know if the company would view this negatively. (i.e. they might think that this overlaps with the role/ responsibilities of their full-time content staff.)

What should I do?","Hye

I'm approaching the end of my industrial PhD, which is multidisciplinary with a major in computer science, under a Marie Curie(MC) Project. I've spent most of my PhD as an employee at a German company in Ireland, adhering to a typical 9-5 schedule. With just two months left on my contract, I've started to draft my thesis, aiming to complete the first version by the time my contract ends.

Last year, my industrial supervisor suggested I could stay and showed interest to keep me in the company. Early this year, there were positive discussions about transitioning me to a permanent role, but as the company missed its revenue targets, they've implemented a hiring freeze. They've mentioned a potential product owner role that might open up after the first quarter of next year. Concurrently, after three interviews, I received another job offer, but this company is also went under a hiring freeze.

I'm currently feeling quite confused and disappointed, and these uncertainties are impacting my ability to focus on my thesis. I've stopped job hunting as it's quite time-consuming and adds to my stress.

Given these circumstances, I'm seeking advice on several points:

1. How can I motivate myself to focus on my thesis amidst this job uncertainty?
2. With both potential job opportunities under hiring freezes, should I wait for the situation at either company to improve, or should I consider other options?
3. The MC PO mentioned that unused research and training budgets might be repurposed for salaryif the company agrees. How should I approach asking for a two-month contract extension using this budget?

"1435","2024-11-27",1732721241,"What Are The Highest Paying Jobs on This List?","So I recently took a look at almost every career there is and made a list of the ones that I'm interested in and would be willing to further pursue in uni. I can't decide on which career I should get into because they're all somewhat interesting to me, so I want salary to be the deciding factor instead.

I've already done my own research on the salaries of each one of these careers from entry level (straight out of college) to mid level and senior level, but they vary by a lot and I figure the people actually working these jobs can provide a better estimate.

Here's the list of careers :

Software engineer - Some people say this job market is oversaturated in 2024 and it truthfully might be, but the salaries are still one of the highest among other jobs. From what I found, HCOL (high cost of living states) entry level graduate software engineers can make TC $200K for FAANG companies. I think mid career salary is around $400k-$600K and senior positions $700K-$1M+. I would assume a non-faang SWE can make around 50%-60% of that?

Data scientist - I've got the least interest in this career, but I heard entry level salary is about $100K HCOL and $200K-$300K for mid career and senior positions because it caps off.

Investment banker - From my research I've found that some entry level IBs can make $200K, mid career around $1M+ and $5M+ in a VP position late career. However, graduating from an Ivy league seems to be a requirement to work for top IB firms, and the working hours are excessive (70-80 hrs a week).

CAA - After a bachelors degree you have to complete a two-year accredited master's degree program in anesthesiology assistant studies from a med school I think. I've got no idea about the salary range for entry/mid/late career, but I hear they make $300K-$500K+ depending on if they're on a payroll or locum (idk what that means). CRNA is a similar job I think but with a little more pay and more time in med school.

Electrical engineer - Not too sure about the salary because EE seems to branch off into many different subsets. I think the top earners make around 50% of what software engineers make working at the same FAANG companies, so around $100K HCOL for entry level, $200K for mid career, and $400K-ish for senior positions. Idk though.

Hardware engineer - I think entry level for FAANG hardware engineers HCOL is around $200K, mid career $300K-$500K, and senior positions around $600K- ? Got this from levels .fyi hardware engineer at google.

Chemical engineer - Maybe $100K for entry level and $200K-$300K mid/late career.

Petroleum engineer - I heard petroleum engineers are the highest paid engineers in terms of average salary, like $100K-$200K entry level and $300K-$800k after a few years. I also heard that there are massive amounts of layoffs when oil prices go down and that it's really hard to find a job right now.

Tech/Insurance/solar/commercial insurance sales - Uncapped potential for income and doesn't even require a uni degree but heard it takes a specific type of person to be a top earner. Possibly 1M+?

Real estate/Mortgage brokers - Heard a lot of people can comfortably make $200K-$300K after a few years. Some people make $1M+ but only the top 0.1%.

Management consultant - Idk what they do but they get paid a lot. Entry level $150K-$200K HCOL, mid career $300K-$400K, $500K-$600K senior position.

So these are all the careers that I'm currently deciding between to study for when I go to uni in a few years

Backstory is important, so Ill try to keep this short &amp; sweet. 

Wifes best friend has successful dad. Successful dad offers me a job out of college. I take it and forever feel indebted to him because of the money I make. Now that you know the cliff notes backstory, I can tell you what happened today.

This year hasnt been the best for me in sales. Ive fallen behind in my numbers, but things are already looking great for 2025. Regardless, my boss calls me yesterday evening. I am at swim class with my 10 month old son. Its the highlight of my week. I miss the call and think oh, Ill just call him back in the morning. I walk into the office this morning to a man belittling me for not calling him back instantly. I was told that it was a promise not threat that I would be on the street if I ever missed a phone call from him again. He went on to say that I need to work around his schedule and not the other way around. He then said, Ill remind you that you work for me, not the other way around.  He went on to say more nasty things and poke me yet again saying that my wife needs to do more at home so I can work more. 

This is where Im stuck. Im too nice. I feel indebted to this man. I make 250k-300k a year by myself. Its helped my family a lot and I am forever grateful for that, but I dont feel like anyone should be talked to like this.

Youre probably asking yourself if theres more to the sorry that would lead him to this. The one thing to add is that I missed a phone call from him about two years ago while I was on a walk with my wife around 7pm. I forgot to call him back the next morning and he lamented me for him. Ever since, he says I never answer me phone and maybe thats why your such a shitty salesman. Mind you, Im doing $10 million plus a year for this company. My number are down this year, but to say Im shitty when Im in the top five of 50+ salesman every year is a stretch.

So my question is, WHAT THE HELL DO I DO?!? My competitions are all full with no open positions. Do I leave and take a lower paying job somewhere for the sake of my sanity and family? Do I stay and tough it out? Am I being a baby? Please any advice or previous experiences would be so helpful.

All the best to you all!

I work for a cool company now and I like everyone, but I just feel so unfulfilled- I dont think corporate life is for me at all!

I have been thinking for the past year and a half that I would like to train in something else.

Im interested in becoming a dental hygienist because its a shorter course than other related ones and still helps people. Plus its just an attractive and respectable profession to me, good hours, decent pay. 

What would the process be for me to go study dental hygiene and therapy? I dont have A level biology which seems to be a requirement so would I have to take that? How would that work? 

Theres definitely a voice in the back of my mind wondering whether its worth it since three years full time study is a lot& whilst I detest the corporate world and the jobs Ive done, I do like having an income. As a hygienist Id probably at least start on less money than I would make in 3/4 years staying in what Im doing. Is there financing available to me whilst studying considering Ive already done an undergraduate degree?

Basically I got accepted into a certaing tech internship/mentoring programme that promised me to assign me a mentor that would be a good fit for me and my interests. I had the interview call about a month ago where I told them that I'm interested in either data analysis or backend dev since that resembles the most the stuff I did during my bachelors and masters. At this point I have multiple programming languages under my belt which I also mentioned during that call. 

The biggest reason I even applied to that internship is that I can't land any entry-level position as a fresh graduate that didn't study a CS degree but has a masters in STEM. But the company assigned me a mentor that is a business graduate, they are already a senior at that company but honestly their field of work has literally nothing in common with what I did and want to do in the future. I have no idea how they could assign someone so ill-fitting for me, that's not saying that they're a bad person or that I have a personal issue with them, it's just that their work position and background is something I would imagine as my personal Hell. 

I've already tried to call the HR and explain this situation to them (in a bit more detail, I'm leaving out some personal details just to be safe) but they told me that basically they don't have enough tech mentors and that the team that was assigning the mentors did their best. They also told me that if it's going to be that unbearable then they might figure something out. The issue is that I don't want to present myself as ""the one that was bitching so much about their mentor that the HR had to switch them"" but I also don't want to do something I quite literally hate.

Ok I fully believe that it's difficult to find a willing employee to become a mentor but do they really mean to tell me that a tech company of around 2 800 eployees can't find a more fitting person than a business graduate for a tech internship where I've already told them that I want to code?

The internship lasts for half a year and I can't imagine doing business stuff during the entire duration... How am I going to put this into my CV? I don't want to waste my time on stuff that is currently the least of my worries when I want to get a career in tech... How should I go about this situation? Should I bear with it and bite my tongue and hope that I might get a tech position in that company afterwards or should I confront the HR again and if they won't be able to do anything about that mentor should I quit?","careerguidance",9,"https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1h12s0n/i_was_assignet_an_illfitting_mentor_for_my/",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"1477","2024-11-28",1732798485,"Im looking for general advice on getting started looking for a new career path, please? [UK]","
Hello,

My situation is that Ive been studying a bachelors degree with a teaching qualification (primary education). TLDR I am on track to graduate with a 2:1 honours degree in June 2025, but not the professional teaching qualification. So now Im looking at basically starting afresh with focusing on a new career path. Im hoping to make an appointment with my uni careers advice service once Ive settled into my new flat (moving next week). 

Through my time on the course, Ive had some significant mental health setbacks and traumatic life events which have meant Ive had to take time out from studying/retake some parts of the course. So Im also a bit concerned now at how my uni transcript will look with gaps/ explaining why Ive been studying for 7 years on a 4 year course. Im currently being referred for an autism assessment. 

I genuinely wanted to go into teaching and enjoyed most of my placements with positive feedback. However, I really struggled with my final placement due to the behaviour management side of things which I wasnt able to be consistent with, it was a class identified with significant behaviour needs but that is becoming more and more the norm nowadays. I believe it was the overstimulating nature of that environment which meant I was struggling to think straight all the time, leading to a negative feedback loop. I had very good feedback otherwise, the uni tutor I had was very encouraging about me becoming a good teacher eventually, but I was advised to withdraw from the placement before failing as I couldnt be signed off on behaviour management standards.

I feel that now, knowing what the core issue is I can hopefully seek support with managing overstimulation and the related issues I was having. If I were to pursue teaching again, I would make sure to volunteer or get a job in a school (eg learning assistant) for a while before applying to the PGDE (postgraduate teaching qualification), to make sure Im ready for that environment again. However, the job situation for newly qualified primary teachers in Scotland has also gone from a good bit of competition to utterly dire, youre not getting work in the time Ive been trying to get through my degree. So for the moment, I dont believe its a good career option. I would rather stay in Scotland, Im not entirely unwilling to move abroad but I have noticed that the places where there are teacher shortages seem to be for good reason due to working conditions.

So this now leaves me a bit unsure of where to focus my attention career-wise. I have one module to complete, to make up the credits equivalent to my final placement, which I will do next term, graduating June 2025. My degree includes some English and linguistics as I was on a literacy specialist track, which Ive really enjoyed studying, but Im not sure about postgraduate study. Im not interested in going into academia. Given where my life has led me, at the moment Id much rather be working, earning, getting settled. Im about to move to a new flat and Id rather not have to move again if I can help it for a couple of years. Its also right next to a train station so a very convenient commuting link to Glasgow. 

I believe I have some good transferable skills, including those I was praised for in my placement reports, e.g. communication, adaptability (ironically being potentially autistic), highly organised, general professionalism and a high drive for professional/personal development, high commitment, creative thinking, analytical thinking (I really enjoyed and did well at the the linguistic analysis assignments on my course). I would enjoy being able to do some training/mentorship of others as this is where I really thrive. I did some work on a voluntary financial education project through my university, where I was given the opportunity to manage a small team of 3 other student teachers which went well. Im just unsure how best to evidence these skills in a CV or interview. Im also unsure how to explain away (if asked) why Im not going into teaching given the degree I will have. 

I have some experience working in hospitality (housekeeping), and leisure (general assistant in soft play and trampoline parks) from part-time/summer jobs during uni. Before starting the course, I was working for a high street bank in a call centre role but had been dipping my toe into becoming involved with training new starters and creating training resources while I was there. 

Because Ive been so focused on teaching, I havent really looked into things like internships, networking, graduate schemes. I feel a bit like Im on the back foot with all that and not sure where to start. I dont take naturally to the whole corporate arse licking/toxic positivity shite; I am polite, considerate and have professional standards for my behaviour and appearance (it was actually noted as a strength on my placement report that I always look and act professional!) but I need a human job. 

So, yes. Advice greatly welcomed.

Right now, I am working at a warehouse. I did college before, graduated with a degree I had no interest in, worked construction, hospitality, and in a warehouse.

I have never known what the hell I wanted to do with my life. No dream job, no interest in any career, I just wanted to experience life and have a good time.

Well, life kicked me in the face and gave me a wake up call. After my first stint working at a warehouse, Covid hit. Right around the same time, my last remaining family member was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer. I was their caretaker for 2 years and it was extremely rough.

When they passed, I decided I wanted to spend my career studying the brain, helping people with brain damage or illnesses, and coming up with new ways of treatment. Sounds pretty good right?

The reality is, I have absolutely no idea where to start. Or rather, there are so many ways to get involved, I have no idea which path to follow.

I could get into medicine. Get my shit together, become a powerhouse, and try to become an MD/DO. I could become an NP, PA, or DPT. I could get into nursing, I could get into imaging.

I could get into science. Study chemistry, biology, pharmacology, neuroscience, etc. Something that lets me work in labs and develop new drugs and treatments.

I could get into technology. Develop hardware and software that improves our ability to interact with, image, and understand the brain.

I just have no idea.

What I have been trying is the tech route. I thought it would be the quickest route. The one that I could get into at the bottom without having to go to school for multiple more years. Where I could get a liveable entry level job that I could do while going back to school for a more specific subject. Turns out, this route is not the easiest and I need schooling just to get an entry level job.

  
I really don't know what to do. I don't enjoy my warehouse job. I don't want to pursue a career working in a warehouse or in logistics. Brain cancer was terrifying. Alzheimers is terrifying. Brain damage and other issues are terrifying. I would like to fight against these things, help others who are in the fight, and maybe make some small contribution to making the world a better place.

I just have no idea what to do.

I would love any advice, input, or hear from anyone who had to make a similar decision.","careerguidance",3,"https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1h1qug4/i_want_to_dedicate_my_career_towards_a_cause_but/",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

After earning my Bachelors degree, I worked in HR, but I quickly realized it wasnt the right fit for me. My decision to pursue a Masters in Data Analytics was influenced by my sibling, who highlighted its high demand and earning potential. After doing my research, I decided to give it a shot.

During the program, I struggled significantly with the coding aspects, as I had no prior experience. There were moments when I wanted to switch majors, but my family and friends encouraged me to persevere, and I did. I eventually graduated, but I discovered that codingparticularly in Python and RStudiowas not something I enjoyed. On the other hand, Im quite comfortable with tools like SQL and Tableau, and I prefer working with them. However, Ive realized I dont want a job that heavily involves programming.

For almost three years now, Ive been trying to secure a role as a Financial Analyst or Business Analyst, but Ive had no luck. This has been incredibly disheartening and has taken a toll on my mental health. I currently work as a concierge for an airline company,, the pay requires me to work over 100 hours every two weeks to make ends meet.  . While the benefits are excellent, its not a role I enjoy. Ive tried to transition within the company, applying for numerous Financial Analyst positions and even making it to the final round in one case, where I interviewed with the VP of Finance and Senior Manager. After waiting three months for a decision, I received a rejection email. Experiences like this have left me feeling stuck.

Ive also applied to other companies and staffing agencies but with little success. Recently, someone from a staffing agency began helping me, which is promising, but I know it could take time to see results. 

Meanwhile, Ive been questioning my career direction. Ive always been drawn to nursing but held myself back, doubting whether I was smart enough for nursing school.
Now, Im considering enrolling in an accelerated nursing program, which takes about 12 months to complete. However, I feel conflicted. On one hand, I feel guilty for not utilizing my Masters degree, thinking of the money invested by my dad and time invested by myself. On the other hand, Im 28 (turning 29 soon) and worry that I might be too old to start over. My husband supports my decision but he is a teacher, so his income wouldnt be enough to cover all our expenses if I had to quit my job to focus on school.

Im scared of facing rejection again, even after completing a nursing program, and I feel traumatized by my current job search. Seeing others around mesome without degreessecure good jobs only adds to my sense of inadequacy. Ive even had a friends daughter remark, She has a Masters degree and still cant find a job? That comment, along with her husbands belief that Im not applying enough, has deeply affected me.

I speak multiple languages, but it doesnt seem to set me apart in the job market. I feel like a failure and Im lost.

At this crossroads, Im torn. Should I keep trying to find a job with my Masters degree or take the leap into nursing, even though it would be a significant financial and emotional challenge? What would you advise?

Background, I studied film and for 8 years I consistently worked a lot in the video production industry, doing producing and editing. I worked in film, tv and corporate fields and did roles in everything across pre-production to post-production. 

Then as the pandemic started I took a job as an operations assistant for a tech company and ended up moving into an operations manager role. I got let go due to AI tech making me redundant, and I started looking for new work. 

Ive been sending resumes for video/film/tv jobs again, but have almost no replies. I thought my wealth of experience here would stand out still but at this point I feel the time I spent away from this speciality has come back to bite me. 

So I instead moved to try get jobs more within what I ended up doing in business operations and client support, and though I initially got a lot of interviews this has dried up and I fear that the longer I am unemployed the more unemployable I become. 

Ive applied for jobs that, from the posting, were exactly the same job Ive done, and excelled in, before. Ive applied for jobs where the job spec was basically what my Wikipedia would be, and nothing. Ive applied for jobs and been told Im over qualified. Ive applied and been told Im under qualified. I apply and apply and I cant find anything. Id say I get an interview 1 out of 100 applications, and I dont even hear back 90% of the time. Ive had my resume checked many times, and no negative feedback was provided.

I thought about doing a course to upskill in marketing or something like that last year, but kept thinking itd be silly to start something in case I got a job and then couldnt see it through. Now Im a year on and feeling silly I didnt, but the same hesitation is even worse cause now I know I cant afford to wait any longer to work. Unemployment benefits ended months ago and Im ploughing through savings frighteningly fast. Im really struggling. I know Im a great worker but I cant seem to convince anyone to give me a chance. 

Does anyone have any advice? At this point I feel incredibly useless and cant see myself ever being hired again. Im not even getting an acknowledgement that Ive even applied 90% of the time. Now when I send an application it feels like Im spitting in the ocean and foolishly expecting someone to notice it.

Unfortunately my current company isnt doing so well, and isnt really paying me what Im worth, especially compared to the other companies. Theres a lot of nepotism (not really in my favour), and Ive been told that theres not really any room for me to move up and theres not really a concrete answer for any career progression or development, even though Ive been pretty clear about what my goals are. 

Theres an opportunity available within a company, but my ex-friend works there.

I recently relocated for a communications role at an Ivy League institution, expecting to focus on storytelling, writing, and strategy. Instead, Ive found myself doing work that feels more like a producer role, which isnt what I signed up for or enjoy.

Heres the situation: Im one of only two hybrid employees on my teameveryone else, including my manager, is fully remote. The only other hybrid team member is supposed to be a videographer/photographer, but he barely works, and the quality of his output is so poor that weve had to hire an external videographer to handle anything important. My manager has told me directly that theres no way to fire him due to institutional policies. Instead, shes asked me to engage him on non-technical tasks without deadlines, which is as useless as it sounds.

A big chunk of my role now involves managing a monthly video series, and I feel like Ive been pushed into the role of a producer rather than a communications professional. Im responsible for:

* Identifying subject matter experts to interview.
* Scheduling the interviews and booking locations.
* Interviewing the experts myself on camera
* Coordinating with the external videographer (since the in-house one is unreliable).
* Editing the videos myself after they are shot, with only a week turnaround.
* Creating animations and voiceovers for the videos.

The problem is, Im not a video editor or animator, nor do I want to be. I expected this role to focus on communications, not technical production. Ive tried to make this clear, but the workload hasnt changed. To make things worse, my salary is low for the high-cost area I moved to, and the stress of all these responsibilities is starting to take a serious toll on my mental health.

Im feeling stuck and unsure if this is just how the communications field operates or if Im in a uniquely bad situation. Wondering if anyone here knows if it is normal for communications roles to include so much video production work? Has anyone else been in a similar situation, and if so, how did you handle it? Should I stick it out or start looking for a new role?

"1518","2024-11-28",1732770052,"Am I crazy for leaving a ~7 figure job for a startup?","Hi all, I'd love your advice on the following situation:

I currently work in Tech and joined company A in Jan 2024. This was a big move for me, as my last company really undervalued/underleveled me, so I basically got a double promotion. An old friend/colleague recruited me to join his late stage startup (company B) - in a new domain with a lot of ownership/agency. This is someone I respect highly and everyone I've backchanneled with has agreed that this person was a fantastic manager.

**Company A**

* Pros:
   * With stock prices soaring right now, my expected comp for next year is around $900K pre-tax. We're not hurting for money right now, due to strong financial planning, but this year *really* helped us 'get further ahead' in our financial goals, and money was never a 2nd thought this year
      * Half of this goes to tax btw, HCOL area
   * Many of my colleagues have told me how impressed they are of me - and that I'm one of the best they've worked with in my role
   * My skip manager is a personal champion of mine - and has told me they plan to carve a path to management for me
   * The benefits are truly top notch - a ton of base vacation days, full PTO on top, full medical coverage for my family, other lifestyle benefits)
   * Actual hours worked is really manageable
* Cons:
   * The company is mind-bogglingly slow - tons of redtape and infighting everywhere
   * The company lacks focus - everything is the ""most important thing""
   * My current manager is okay, but we aren't on the same wavelength - so I feel like I spend extra mental energy getting him on the same page
   * Lots of folks at the company are what I'd consider to be mediocre, especially compared to my last company. This slows down a lot of my work and leaves me to pick up a lot of their slack
   * The domain I've been working in I know very well, but I'm getting extremely bored of
   * I literally end the day physically ""ill"" some days. Headaches, deep dread etc because of how much I'm not enjoying my work

**Company B**

* Pros:
   * Working with old colleague as a manager/mentor
   * Smaller team/early influence on the culture
   * Everyone I've interviewed with is extremely impressive - all ivy/top 5 public school types (similar to company prior to A)
   * Domain is new to me and poses a new challenge
   * Opportunity to leverage new technologies like AI
   * I really believe in the product/mission
* Cons:
   * Compensation really. The base is pretty good (slightly higher than Company A actually) but everything else is paper money until an exit. Most of my company A compensation is tied up in RSUs

I'm trading away security in compensation (company A) for more interesting/enjoyable work and better team/maybe better mental health (company B). If the difference were - say, 50-100k, I think it would be a no brainer for me, but the delta is massive and I'd be walking away from a lot of money in the short-term (assuming my new-hire grants dry up and I don't get refreshers), so it feels kind of foolish/crazy on the one hand - but I'm really struggling with work enjoyment at my current company.

Another thing to note is that I actually really enjoy work/am a workaholic when the work is interesting or there's team momentum, so the hours don't bother me - and that's how shocked I am at how much I've hated the current work I do.

the reason I chose engineering technologies was because I can minor in something like communications which is really where I excell at since I have always loved writing and I am very good with people and presenting ideas. but as I started researching the et major, I thought it was gonna be a bad idea because I would have two degree types that have low rates of employment instead of just going all out on one.

For context, Im currently working at a large Fortune 50 corporation in the Midwest (USA). Ive been here for 8 years and consistently had strong reviews, including a promotion from L7 to L8 while working in corporate FP&amp;A. About 3 years ago, I moved to a BU-focused team, recruited by a professional acquaintance who is my manager. Thats where the trouble began.

Over the past three years, this manager has bullied me, micromanaged my work, and threatened me multiple times. I should note that I was quite independent in my prior role, leading projects and programs on my own, so this shift was jarring. Despite this, Ive continued to meet expectations and have no history of underperformance (no PIP or needs support ratings).

In May, after 2.5 years of enduring this behavior, I reached out to my HR Business Partner (HRBP). I shared a recording of one interaction where my managers behavior was especially egregious. The HRBP immediately told me to delete the recording, saying it violated company policy and could lead to termination. I complied and assured them I hadnt recorded other conversations.

The issue was escalated to Employee Relations (ER). They interviewed me and took some action, though I wasnt told what that entailed. Unfortunately, in October, my position was eliminated as part of restructuring. My manager remains in their role, and Ive been asked to look for internal opportunities.

Heres the problem: Any hiring manager for an internal role will likely reach out to my current manager for a reference. Given our history, Im confident they will speak negatively about me, which could damage my chances.

Ive always had a solid reputation and strong reviews, but I feel stuck. How can I mitigate the potential damage from my managers reference while applying for internal roles? Should I approach HR to intervene?

Any advice or insights from HR specialists, managers, or others whove been in similar situations would be greatly appreciated.","careerguidance",1,"https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1h1nhyo/throwaway_my_manager_bullied_me_for_3_years_hr/",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

My current commute is in average 1 hour in and 1.5 hours out, 5 days a week.

Casino is a home to me because of how long I've been there and I've been treated well and have a good boss. Nice perks are occasional concert and sports tickets in our suite.

I've been offered a job at a school district. Pay is equal, commute trainer? only 6 minutes. Plus they get a state employee pension. I'm 45 so I could do 20 years and retire with the full pension.

I'm hesitating accepting this new job and I'm unsure why. I think it's just how long I've been at the Casino and all of the comforts that comes with that. Reducing my commute will give back a lot of time for myself and my 10 year old son.

Ive decided to go on a gap year because I have absolutely no idea what career to get into. I feel as though I want to do, and be, too much in life; an artist, a psychiatrist, a lawyer, a marine biologist, etc. I have no idea where to start or how to take the first step into deciding. 

Im not too fussed about going to university, as Im not too keen on the night life aspect of it and so on. Thats the only thing that puts me off a little bit. However, I love learning new things, no matter what it is. So I feel as though going to uni would be good for me. On that note, Ive thought about doing a degree apprenticeship, or even an apprenticeship on its own quite a lot. I love the idea of being able to learn, whilst earning a wage. My only problem is that I have no idea what will suits me. 

In regard to hobbies, Ive always loved art, and creating things no matter how big or small. A good example of this would be cooking, I love following a recipe but also putting my own spin on it, I also love seeing the end product. I also love being outside as much as I can, as I get bored easily from being inside. (On a side note, I did think about becoming an architect as I feel as though it correlates with the creativeness and not being completely confined to a desk. I tried work experience at a local architects office for a few months and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I didnt pursue it because I dont have the right qualifications to go to uni to study architecture, and it would take too long to reach my goal, and the student debt would be too much.)

In regard to academic subjects that interest me, I loved studying psychology and law in college. I loved the complexity of psychology, and how therere infinite things to study and understand coming from an individualistic approach. With law, I loved being able to apply the knowledge I had learnt into specific scenarios I was given. 

I understand that no one can tell me what career to get into, but I would love if I could have some help brainstorming careers that I havent thought of even heard of.

But Ive got a few concerns, and Im hoping some of you can share your experiences and adviceespecially if youve worked at Alten or know about them.


Here's my situation:

The pay drop is pretty steepId go from earning £45k+ to around £34kbut Ive got some savings, so I can manage for a while.

Alten doesnt seem to have a great reputation on Reddit or Glassdoor. Some people say career progression is poor, they don't care about the employee's career direction and they dont pay employees well.

Ive heard that having experience at consultancies like on your CV can make you seem less capable since you didn't get a direct role at a company like Airbus or Rolls-Royce.

I've also heard that consultants end up doing the work that no one else wants in the client company...


Questions Ive got:

1. Has anyone here worked at Alten UK (or Alten in Europe)? Whats it really like, and would you recommend it?

2. Hows the aerospace job market looking in the UK right now? Is it worth jumping in, or should I hold out for a direct role at the major OEMs?

3. If I take this role, how can I position myself to eventually land a direct job at a big aerospace company?

4. Once youre in aerospace, is it easy to climb the ladder and get back to a better salary?

5. How can I make sure I get meaningful projects and not just the boring stuff no one else wants?


If youve made a similar move or know someone who has, Id really appreciate hearing about it. Any advice is welcome!

Job 1: 15% target bonus, 5% 401k match immediately vested, can invest 6% more of 401k as post-tax contribution due to lower threshold to get match, $2.2k annual incentives, 29 days PTO

Job 2: 8-10% target bonus, medical insurance cost is 60% cheaper than job 1, 4% 401k match vests over 5 years, 75k retention incentive if I stay for 5 years (prorated after 2 years), $1k annual incentives, 16/8/2 days PTO/sick leave/floating holidays

"1558","2024-11-27",1732749553,"Should I continue to pursue my complex career in acting and journalism or just pursue law school instead? ","I just turned 26 years old and have not been more confused about what I want my career path to be than ever now...I grew up doing theatre and acting in middle and high school, landing lead roles and getting into advanced acting classes; I was always told I was good at it and fell in love with it. I knew it was a career I wanted to pursue, and it inspired me to audition for acting programs for different conservatories and liberal arts colleges. 

I got accepted into various programs and attended a college in Colorado for theatre arts and acting. I enjoyed it for the most part, and I graduated in 2020. I hadn't realized the difficulty of getting a liberal arts degree would be when it came to finding work, so I just right away began working for my parents post-college, helping them out with their businesses for a couple of years; following that, I pursued my master's in Professional Creative Writing in 2022 with the intention to pursue a career in reporting and journalism. Since graduating last year, I have yet to land a stable job or a consistent income in that field. I have applied to countless editor, associate editor, reporter, staff writer, and blog writer roles, and nothing has stuck. It's been a tough industry to break into. 

I took on a couple of pro bono writing internships when pursuing my master's in order to build a writing portfiolio. I ended up publishing 17 articles with one blog writing company. Once I graduated, I landed a part-time job for a small indie magazine as a reporter and freelancer with inconsistent pay (pay is very slow and is 60-90 days out...it was stated on the form I signed before I accepted the job and I was taking whatever opportunity was coming my way). I have written and published 20+ articles for the magazine since and haver been with them for over a year now and I am also publishing a couple more articles from different news outlets before the end of the year. I have emailed countless reporters and journalists in the industry asking to connect and meet for coffee to get their advice on the industry and ways to find opportunities as a young journalist/writer in the industry. I have a meeting with a journalist next week who claims he will help me get a good opportunity at his news station. I was also told by one of the news outlets that I am writing an article for that they are looking for a new editor at the end of the year as well and I expressed my interest...so those are possible opportunities for potential jobs, but of course, I don't want to expect these things to just fall into my lap. 

With all that being said, I have a very complicated relationship with my family, who hate that I do the arts and my creative mindset and they've always resented the idea of my acting career. They are more fond of my writing career, but since I haven't landed a consistent and regal job after graduating with my master's (it's been over a year now), they think it is a useless degree and industry  and are starting to second guess my future success. They have always pressured me and wanted me to go to law school since I was a kid and they want me to become a lawyer and I resented it for the longest time. I recently, probably in the past year or so have considered law school as it could be a fruitful career route, and I am very concerned about my financial stability in the future and think I could find stability in that. My younger brother, who is currently studying political science at UCLA, also intends to pursue law, and hearing how he has explained things and the different ways my parents treat him and put him on a pedestal over me has pushed me into considering law school, for that sense of security, acknowledgement, and safety. I know my passion lies in writing and acting...I am just lost at what to do because I need a good job, I need a good income for a sense of livelihood. Is it delusional to say that I could pursue all three?

Should I continue pursuing my journalism/reporting and acting career and stick it out for as long as possible and see where it takes me, or is it about time I settled for my plan B for stability and contentment? (I also want to clarify that I am interested in many aspects of law, and my parents would for sure pay for my law school, so school debt and paying for school isn't an issue.)

As the title says, I (33F) recently (like last week recently) started a new role at a different company. It's still in my field, but a pretty big step up in many ways- pay, responsibility, impact on the industry, amount I'm learning, and the fact that my boss is actually super cool and respects me for my experience and knowledge. It's awesome (so far, I know he honeymoon phase is a thing).

Something I keep getting hung up on, though, is that I find myself being genuinely anxious and nervous because of how seemingly chill, welcoming, and kind everyone is. I've gotten so used to getting in trouble for every little thing and micromanaged at my old job that I'm fearful that the other shoe will drop and it will start happening here. 

A little bit of backstory- my old workplace was incredibly misogynistic and I got unfairly targeted and harassed because I spoke up often about mistreatment of myself and others. There was one manager in particular that purposefully excluded me from meetings I needed to be part of to do my job, put me on a bogus corrective action (that I fought and won), and sabotaged my projects regularly, amongst so many other things. When I tried to report it, I got shut down by HR and other management. I felt very isolated and defeated most of the time there. 

So, what I want to ask is, for those of you that made a transition from a toxic workplace to a seemingly healthy one, did you experience the same fear? How did you work through it? I want to be excited and passionate about this new role, and I feel like some of this fear is holding me back.

I have my high school diploma and I did duel-enrollment (community college while still in HS) during my senior year. So I do have some college credits/started working on an associates degree.

So I started working full time and havent found a good opportunity to go back to college yet. (its something Id like to continue at some point tho) 

I started working at 16 for Target doing order fulfillment/ picking and shipping. I was there for 3 years then left for another retail order fulfillment job. Ive been at that company for 3 years now too. 9 months after getting hired, I was promoted to an assistant manager position. 

So I have a HS diploma and some college and then experience in customer service, warehouse operations, inventory management, fulfillment, leadership etc. 

I am extremely interested in career advancement/higher pay at the moment. My current job does not really have room for growth at the moment and the company is actually in a tricky position that brings me a lot of concern with job security throughout the next year. (its complicated) Other jobs in my area for warehouse/inventory/fulfillment management do not pay very much, either less or the same as what I currently make so I feel like I cant just find a new job. 

I really enjoy what I do, but I find the most enjoyment in the things that arent part of my job description. 

* I love creating solutions to problems and finding ways to improve efficiency for operations and for the employees. 
* I reallyyy love solution focused analysis of data discrepancies. 
* I enjoy how my job is a perfect mixture of being on my feet and computer work. I couldnt stand to be sitting at a desk all day, everyday. It makes me sleepy if its too excessive. 
* I like looking into the specifics of orders and inventory history to figure out what the issue is, how it went wrong, and then figuring out how to prevent the same problem from occurring again or documenting the problem and communicating with other people that can fix the problem. 
* I thrive in high stress, fast paced environments as long as I am well equipped enough that I either have all the knowledge and tools needed, or I have the flexibility and authority to make executive decisions on a needed basis. (Im aware that this is not always a realistic ask and that sometimes you have to just make-do with very little)
* I consider myself to be very creative and meticulous. 
* Ive always been interested in graphic design, behind-the-scenes operations, planning and execution. 
* I enjoy a mixture of working alone and with a team, but I have really enjoyed my experience in management.

This entire post is essentially just me asking if anyone has any ideas on what I could do. Im open to returning to school as I really enjoy learning. Financially it wont be easy but, if its necessary, I can make it work. I know I lack a lengthy history of experience because of my age, but Im driven and dedicated to learn whatever I need to. Im just feeling very lost and stuck at the moment. I want to make more money and I want to advance further up in a career, but I dont even know where to go or whats possible. Any advice is appreciated, even if its just solace for my quarter life crisis lol TIA","careerguidance",1,"https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1h2fj4v/what_are_some_careersjobs_that_i_could_pivot_to/",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

She said nursing, I told her that she seemed like she doesnt actually enjoy the idea of it but more or less the accomplishment of being a nurse. After I said that, it made me realize that I too think I am going into nursing for the main reason of accomplishment and pleasing my parents. I know that sounds dumb but I grew up with the mindset of being a nurse and then going back to school to become a doctor because it was what my parents wanted for me. So I did exactly that. Now dont get me wrong, I absolutely love working in hospitals and helping others, it brings me a lot of comfort and accomplishment. I enjoy being there to make someones life better or just helping someone even a little. Which is why I definitely thought nursing was a good fit for me because I enjoy the environment and actually care about my job and what I do and not just the money.

However I am having second thoughts because I feel like Id succeed in business a lot more. I would have more time for my family, my kid(s) and myself. I feel it may be less mentally exhausting for me. After finding out I was pregnant, I feel like I want to sacrifice nursing for business. Im not sure if I am making the right choice though.

"1571","2024-11-29",1732858044,"I want to teach -- but I don't know what, so I don't know what the next step is for me...?","I'm in my last year of undergrad as a communications major, and I've dabbled in a few areas, from film production (narrative, commercial and documentaries), arts journalism (music and film), photojournalism, film studies, some more art-leaning photo projects, and even a research paper on online attitudes towards AI ethics.

I think at the back of my mind I've always known that I wanted to teach - my first ambition as an 8-year-old was to become like my then form teacher. In high school I thought I might teach History or Economics. And now I'd say I would love to teach at the college level. The problem is that I could see myself teaching so many things -- whether it's becoming a music journalist, then going back to teach as a Prof of Practice; pursuing a PhD in film studies / cultural studies and teaching classes related to my research; or even pursuing an MFA to work on personal documentary and photography projects, and teaching from a more art-minded approach.

I am aware that pursuing academia means research is the primary job and teaching comes second, so that's also a consideration -- I can't say for sure I know what I want to research, so it makes it hard for me to be able to commit to saying I want to research a specific area.

I also don't have the art school background that I feel a BFA gives many people, to be able to feel like an MFA would be a continuation of an established body of work with the ability to think fully like an artist (although I do have a number of documentary films, photojournalistic works, and more personal films/projects as well).

And I get the feeling that if I step into the world of journalism I would just give up the idea of teaching ... even though obviously a good educator in this field typically has those many years of experience.

The fig tree analogy feels incredibly overwhelming! At the end of the day, I feel like so many educators in my life have inspired me, and it's typically because of who they are as human beings, and the life advice they've given me along the way, outside of the syllabus. I want to shape lives and impact the youth in the same way, plus I love the environment of schools.

So it's this mix of... I'm interested in so many things! I have commitment issues! I want to do it all! But also none of it truly matters because I see them more as ways to connect and impart knowledge, wisdom, and passion!

Throw-away account here - I've been in the staffing world for over 2 decades, having been in management on-and-off for a while (total of 6-7 years added together). Currently interviewing for a possible regional leader position. I would be managing/leading MD's who oversee their office (6 in total). P&amp;L is about $45M.

Largest P&amp;L I was responsible for was $20M with sales people spread across 3 major hubs on the east coast - so not a huge jump there, but the difference now is managing managers.

That said - I would really appreciate suggestions on what I can showcase with the last 2 folks I am speaking with. Any points that I can make sure I bring up?

I took an IQ test, which was the WAIS-IV and got 82 as a full-scale IQ score with low processing speed.
When I was in school, it would normally take a longer time for me to understand the lesson. In order to get straight A grades, I would have to study twice as hard as others to get the same result in passing the subjects.I would have to go through my notes over and over again to retain information.


Unfortunately, I am very bad at my social skills as well, which is the part of my life that really messes with me mentally. Everytime I talk to people or meet new people, I struggle to form coherent sentences and to formulate a good conversation in front of them. I believe that I am neurodivergent as well.



I would struggle to even know what to say or mention to the next person without sounding like a complete idiot. I would say and do embarrassing things that would make others to have such a horrible and awful image of me. It's embarrassing and that scarred my mind really bad.



One of the biggest fears of mine is not holding down a job and living a long life. Anytime when it's a new job, I will struggle to understand the information and the tasks required for me at the first time. I would make many, many mistakes that become horrible overtime. I would have to ask repeatedly for the task to be repeated. I would really struggle to hold on to the job for a long time and it caused me to get fired or to quit the job in less than a few months. It's like I am doomed to manual labor jobs or retail work. I don't want to be stuck in poverty. I am even struggling to understand how I would have to pay back $35,000 in college student loans 



I really struggled with learning new and advanced concepts more efficiently whenever it came to programming or medicine. I really hated this life or mine and it seemed like overcoming was a very difficult thing for me. Is there good paying jobs that are at least paying $60k or above? Be brutally honest here please.

For some background I worked at a major big box retailer for 4 years (wasnt promoted, i was offered, but didnt like the management as they were toxic so declined) while i got my degree. I have worked every position possible in a big box retailer, from unloading to stocking, to scheduling, to cashier, personal shopper etc. I got my degree and went into an entry level social worker role (a little under a year) had to quit because i moved a few hours away. 

Got a healthcare role in my new city that had a toxic work environment, employees (not me) werent meeting deadlines, not filing government paper work properly, lying to insurance and a bunch of random other stuff. I ended up going from overseeing one clinic to two and we just kept losing employees so i got burnt out and quit.  (around 10 months in role).

I had some vacation I had to take that was gonna make me be gone for a few weeks out of the rest of the year, so I moved into a fast food role, got promoted twice to lower level training roles, and offered to be a manager, but I would have to wait until a spot opens up. The position has been moved back multiple times due to funding, and other issues so im a little worried it wont open up in the near future and i really need the pay increase, and pto increase. Went from thinking it would open in November or December to next May/June. 

TLDR Im really looking to go back to retail and was just wondering if i applied to be a manager at a big box retailer again do you think my last 3 jobs would be held against me. One I quit because I moved, and another because of the bad work environment. Im in really good standing at my current job but I cant see myself staying there, in my role, any longer then maybe 2 more months before losing my mind = which is why i wanted to move up.

If someone can blurt out an idea for a profession the might possibly suit me, that would be wonderful. I'm in high school and still have 2 years before post-secondary school, by the way.



* Huge passion for literature; can't stop reading.
* Interest in liberal arts and human behaviour (philosophy, psychology, sociology, history...)
* Introverted as hell and absolutely cannot speak in front of the public.
* I love writing and thrive with essays, but I don't think I would enjoy it being the majority of a job.
* I love doing little tasks around the place, love organizing.
* Ideally independent work with support.
* Emotionally sensitive as a person, meaning jobs like lawyer are out of the question, for example.
* Job security is very important for me. I need to feel some safety regarding employment.
* STEM is not for me and I HATE MATH SO MUCH I JUST CAN'T DO IT!!!!!
* Not financially driven and not materialistic. Would rather have average pay for a job I adore than amazing pay for a job I dislike.
* Good grades sprinkled with lack of money for post-secondary education.

Extra, semi-unrelated:

* I will literally romanticize anything in everything. I'll find beauty where there is none, and meaning in places devoid of purpose.
* An ideal world for me would be if I could just study subjects I love and learn the things I'm interested in. I wish life was just about being a college/university student. I would really, really love being a professor if I didn't hate teaching so much.
* This is not a priority, but I'm in love with Toronto, the city I'm very close to and get to visit sometimes, and oh my god, living downtown there would be a dream come true. It's, however, expensive and (I believe) unrealistic for me.



Extremely brief summary:

* Books yes. Human behaviour and history yes.
* Public speaking no. Teaching no. Complex math no way.
* Job security and happiness very important
* Preferred environment: peaceful, quiet, generally alone but with support.
* Salary not the most important
* Currently has good grades and no money

Thank you so, so much for reading the whole thing. Your suggestion, no matter how brief, will really help me and put my mind at ease. If most of these at the same time is unrealistic, please give me a reality check and humble me. Have a good day you guys &lt;3

***Tl;dr:*** I'm (30 y/o) an accomplished ""fixer"" bookkeeper with several years of experience in a variety of environments and business types, some of which I managed ***all*** financials for. I also have in-company glowing references all the way up to people on our corporate operations team. After moving to a corporate bookkeeping position, where's the wall in career growth without a degree? If I did go to school for accounting, what are the chances I'll feel burned when they don't care because my experience outweighs it?

The too long part with more context:

I'm (30 y/o) a location bookkeeper (previously manager) for a casino/convenience store corporation.

I just started on the convenience store side a couple months ago, having been a manager on the casino side for about a year and a half (which I primarily did their books there too). 

Before that, for about five years I did all the financials (accounting, taxes, bookkeeping, payroll) for my own small business and my friend's smoke shop I worked part time at (probably still would be if not for him passing away).

That all said, no schooling beyond the HS diploma.

The casino was pretty ""plug and play"" since it was 90% cash. The convenience store location I transferred to was much bigger and more complex than anything I'd worked with before, and was in an absolute state with constant swinging variances before I arrived (talking sometimes hundreds of dollars back and forth per day). 

Despite having basically just started, in a brand new environment for me, I already thoroughly understand everything to the point I've more or less corrected the issues and gotten our variances much more under control, and have figured out all kinds of tricks for finding issues. 

Which my manager happily attests to regularly since that's been screwing her bonus. I also created new spreadsheets for everything, which has made it simpler for whoever does books on my days off, but I do always go back and fix it even when they have bad days.

I'm on the fast track to a corporate office position as a bookkeeper, with connections in the company going all the way up to the operations teams, but I can't help but wonder.. what then?

I love my job. I imagine I'd love that job. But if I decide that's not a ""rest of my life"" situation, where would I go from there? And moreover, do I need a degree? 

I don't want to be in a position five years down the road where I want to continue forward but I'm stuck because the next positions up strictly require a degree. But I also don't want to get there and they don't give a shit about a degree with my experience, so it'll have been wasted time and money.","careerguidance",1,"https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1h2c65i/is_it_worth_going_back_to_school_despite_my_age/",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"1612","2024-11-28",1732837303,"Feeling stuck after graduationshould I pursue a job or a master's abroad? Looking for advice and mentorship in web development","Hi everyone,

23F, graduated in 2022 with a triple major in biotechnology, chemistry and botany.After graduation, I felt lost and unsure of what to do next. I briefly considered preparing for CAT but didnt go through with it. I then tried sales for two months but quickly realized it wasnt the right fit for me.

Initially, I considered continuing with life science, but I felt that the scope to make a good income in India wasn't as high, and I wanted to explore opportunities abroad. However, at that time, my parents weren't exactly willing to support me in that direction. Now, they are more open to me pursuing a master's abroad if that's the path I choose.

I also thought about pursuing data science at one point, but I didnt follow through. This year, I decided to focus on learning web development by myself and have successfully completed courses in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Bootstrap. Im currently learning backend development, but I feel stuck in a loop where I keep learning without applying my skills in real-world projects. Im too scared to start applying for jobs because I dont feel ""ready"" yet.

Im also worried that time is passing by too quickly, and Im considering pursuing a masters abroad in a relevant field like computer science or software engineering. I initially thought about doing a distance MCA but have now ruled that out after reading a lot of negative feedback about distance learning programs.

Right now, Im at a crossroads and unsure whether I should:

Start applying for web development jobs with my current skills, even though I dont feel fully prepared yet?
Pursue a master's degree abroad in a relevant field to gain formal education and credentials, while also potentially opening up more career opportunities?
My main goal is to gain real-world experience, continue learning, and grow my skills in the software development field. I also feel like I need a mentor to guide me through this uncertain phase, as Im struggling with decisions and direction.

Id really appreciate any advice, personal experiences, or suggestions on how to move forwardwhether I should dive into job applications, try for an internship, or pursue further education.","careerguidance",1,"https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1h28r8n/feeling_stuck_after_graduationshould_i_pursue_a/",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"1617","2024-11-28",1732832798,"How did you decide on your Career?","Hello,

I have questions that need your knowledge and expertise. 
From general aviation to possible life advice. To give you a quick rundown, I'm looking into being a pilot. 

Now, this is one (of many) careers/jobs I've looked into. I've realized at this point in my life. That the only thing I'm getting, is older. I'm 25 yrs old and haven't given myself any skills to expand upon and grow into a career path. Or more likely haven't realized my skillset to utilize and become a career. 
As every person does, we have interests. Flying, for me, is one of them. I see the glory of what experienced pilots make per year and the prestige of the job they do. It's respectable, and generally something you can say you're proud to be doing. 
I've brought myself to a point, in what I want to do is establish a valuable skillset that can support me financially. 
With this, as I said before, brought me to looking into MANY careers. 
- Electrician, Plumber, Pipe Fitter
- Train Conductor
- Cyber Security
- Pilot

I've looked all over the place, and i've read subreddit after subreddit. Checked out questions about these jobs. Researched and delved into publically available knowledge. Asked people who LIVE in these careers on the day to day about how they got where they were. I've seen a LOT of doom&amp;gloom. With many saying the grass isn't green over here. Many giving the old ""Don't bother you'll never make it"" but I ask: Could a broke man with a dream make it? 

but the reason I come here is for this.
In any regard, being a pilot, is a lot of people's dream. 
So I made a pact with myself, to live a fulfilling life. No matter what happens, my job needs to meet these criteria:
- Would this career provide me with financial stability? 
- Could I reasonably build a career and retire in this line of work? 
- In this profession recession proof? If the worst came to our economy. Am I out of a job? 
- Would I be able to have a good home/life to work ratio? Will I be worked to death?
- How long will it take working in this profession before I can financially support myself? 
- Would I be happy in this line of work?
- Can I start this career with nothing?

There's probably more questions I could ask, but, that's all I could conjure up for now. 
In any case, as you can tell, these are mainly questions I need to answer myself. But I wouldn't be asking this if I didn't want your opinions and general life experience on these matters. I could sit here and think all day but it would mean nothing when I could ask 10, 100, or 1000 people who have all lived such wildly different experiences. With so much knowledge and life decisions that I could learn from. I'd be a fool to sit here and not ask. 

If you've stuck around this long, I thank you. I've hit that point in my life that my brain decided to fully develop. Now with this crushing mass pushing against the front of my skull. I look at where I'm at in life and just generally want more. Not just for myself, but hopefully in the future my family. I could stay where I'm at and just meander on through life. Drifting in the endless waves, getting pulled back and forth. 
But no, I want to grab onto the reigns of my life and take hold.  To steer myself into a successful direction and with your knowledge. Be able to guide myself into positive life decisions filled with content. 

I'm pretty willing to get started anywhere that can guarantee me at least half of my checklist. I know the beginning is always the roughest. But I'm willing to stick out the storm. 
Where should I start? What career(s) could even be promising without needing me to get that golden ticket? Or to have such wealth backing me that failure isn't considered? 

All I have is time, a willing heart, and a developed mind (hopefully). ","careerguidance",1,"https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1h27cj0/how_did_you_decide_on_your_career/",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"1618","2024-11-28",1732832015,"I feel lost. What can I do?","
Hello all,

I for the last 3 years have worked at a contact center for Merrill/bank of America on the wealth management team, my responsibilities are servicing wealth management clients and FAs/CAs that will call in on behalf of the clients servicing includes updating Merrill/Bofa personal information, going over activity/statements, regular banking services reordering checks, paying credit cards etc, and online banking I recently also started getting skilled for mortgage and small business calls as well. 

I do well in my current role in most ways, except the heaviest weighted benchmark which is client satisfaction. The issue there is clients are sent a survey after the call via email that they have to score the associate as well as Merrill/BofA but the clients simply just dont read the questions when theyre upset/unreasonable. They will mark 1s for all 5 questions then in the note box they will praise me then bash the bank. My management will see this and still say I couldve done better explaining the survey or some other comment that just is not helpful in anyway. (I as much as I can explain the survey the first two questions are about me the rest is about the bank I hope my service meets all your needs! We aim for 9s and 10s here at Merrill!).

The bank wants all associates to be at 95% to be in the green anything below that is a fail.

Only 9s and 10s are worth a point everything else is a 0. 

I have been applying to WFM for awhile now. There was an entry level role that I qualified for so I reached out to the hiring manager to ask if I can shadow one of his associates, which I then did and it went great asked a bunch of great questions and learned a lot about the role. Then I got the interview for the same role. I believe I did very good on the interview I was already very familiar with the systems they use because I used them myself to peek at the queues while on calls, and I was very proactive with having my management change my skilling based on what line of business was queueing up to get it cleared out.

I believed I was the perfect candidate for the role. After the interview I emailed the hiring manager and the team manager thanking them for their time, no response. A week later I emailed both again following up thanking them for the opportunity and looking forward to speaking again, no response again. I check my workday portal everyday to see if the status on my application will change to anything other than interviewing. Another week later my application is no longer on my dashboard, never received a rejection email, emailed the hiring manager one last time asking for pointers for the future and any reason why I wasnt selected, no response again.

I was ghosted from both the hiring manager and the team manager I do not understand for the life of me why, I reached out to my management to let them know and ask their input and they were shocked but nothing can be done 

I feel helpless. I still apply everywhere but no interviews since then. Most of my applications are internal and I have a good standing with no verbals or write ups and getting a meets every year for the last 3. 

I just want to be off the phones and advance Ive been stagnant and speaking with clients that make you feel like youre not getting anywhere after an hour of explaining what a statement balance is for a credit card is driving my nuts.

I just want a role thats not client facing at this point I dont care what it is Im just tired.

Note: I do have my bachelors degree in business management as well I recently graduated this year.

Please any advice would be deeply appreciated.

She said she will support me whenever needed. She also said that it's not performance related at all (perf is really good) but more of an ""attitude' thing which kind of baffled me cause im usually a very quiet guy and all my previous managers never had problems with me.

I am totally lost about what to do next. I complete my masters in 4 months and I have absolutely no plan. There are 2-3 routes which commonly people take at this stage, first is give CSIR NET entrance exam for PHD research in govt institutions, second, give the same exam but to become an assistant professor at institutions, and thirdly get into biotech or pharmaceutical industry(Quality control or assurance). I seem to have no strong liking towards all the three paths, No for research as it has a lengthy tenure, I have less patience for research, don't want that ""constant studies"" environment anymore, and most importantly not so passionate about it which is said to be the most important requirement to get into research. A huge No for professor as I am bad at teaching, and I just want to get done with the college life and studies, cant do the same thing all over again being a professor in college, lastly industry, this is a good option out of all three but salary is minimal, no growth, no job security, plus repeated similar work every single day. I am mostly convinced for the industry option as I can switch later, and have plans to learn coding and analytics and get into bioinformatics or hopefully IT sector(far fetched but yeah) which have better pay scale. But there is a constant WHAT IF? in my head. what if research works out, what if I go abroad(Germany or US) and I get good opportunities after research?, what if I never get a promotion or a bioinformatics job in industry and get stuck at a basic technician role with below average salary? What if I should just follow my actual interests i.e. Event management and tourism instead of playing it safe?

All these things are running in my head constantly and I'm not able to decide. And the clock is ticking away. Please share your insights. Guide me through this.

"1641","2024-11-28",1732819576,"Should I Have Gotten a Raise?","I started working for a medium sized SaaS firm earlier this year. I got the job because of nepotism straight up, but I ended up being really well qualified for it too which I guess was a bonus. 

Anyhow the job entailed being the technical writer on a team of 5 in which 2 of the team members were there to facility learning of systems and training, they were our seniors/mentors. My partner in the team was there to facilitate client side communication, prospecting for proposals, etc. The lat team member was someone from Devops who configured a bot for us to use in our writing, they left soon after I joined and I quickly learned how to configure the bot on my own. I literally only have experience in 3 industries: sales, writing and tech - so this was lucky. 

Just over 4 months into the new team, our mentors recognized that I had the sales and managerial prowess to not only manage the technical writing, but also maintain the funnel, CRM, prospects, even maintain our bots, etc. Effectively they ""realized the role only required one person."" But I'm of the thought that I also stepped up to that plate by being super versatile. I feel like I basically got a ""soft-
 promotion"". I became THE manager of this one man team, and my partner in the team simply became a rep in the pre-sales dept. 

At the time of the transition I mentioned that I felt like this warranted either a raise or a full-time contract of employment, since I'm just a contractor who clocks hours weekly. I was told we needed more time to prove that the new campaign was working but that it was in the cards. 

Since then I have basically automated everything my partner was doing, taken responsibilities from legal and compliance and taken an even more active role in the sales process while also maintaining my ""writing"" duties. I also automated the bot's knowledge base. 

Now at the 6 month mark, we are now at a point where our new team has proven it can generate a sizeable amount of revenue. We are moving toward implementing new technology to be even more efficient in the process so that we can focus on growth rather than efficiency. I'm now interviewing vendors for solutions, looking at our long term strategy, etc. 

Now my question is, if you hired someone to basically be a glorified data capturer and then they ended up being this resourceful - don't you think they'd deserve a raise or at least a real seat at the table after 6 months? They've already expressed the fact that ill always have a place in the company, but why dangle the carrot in my face then? 

TL;DR: I feel I was given a ""soft promotion"" and want to know if you think I should have gotten a raise?","careerguidance",4,"https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1h22t4r/should_i_have_gotten_a_raise/",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"1642","2024-11-28",1732818454,"How do I choose between two career pathways while pursuing my passion?","I am 22, currently a 4th year apprentice plumber in the local union. I have about a year and a half to go before I turn out, and I will likely do so at the top of my class. I've been working at a good company for two years now, and the general foreman who specifically chose me and took me in likes my work *a lot.* I have a work phone and work ipad, I do small detailing projects, I do office work quite a bit which is extremely rare for an apprentice. When I turn out, I will be making around 76 an hour before tax, plus excellent medical benefits and retirement/pension etc. For example, right now I have no healthcare premium, and all my visits and medications have been about 10-20 bucks each. 

I live with my brother. Rent is approximately 1700 a month each. Utilities total another 500. I eat out a lot. Net worth around 100k including retirement accounts, which I'm happy about to have reached before 25. I am in a good spot, and so is my brother.

I have moderate autism, adhd, and an unspecified psychotic disorder. I am on meds, but not on antipsychotics because they make me so sleepy. I sleep lots anyways, and have a cpap machine. It's tough, but I manage. I have been noticeably less stable lately but I'm trying to change insurance to get a better mental health team.

My general foreman/mentor has spoken to me a lot about how being in the field might not be the ultimate goal for me, and that I should shoot higher such as project manager at the company. He told me they have long hours and make mostly commission(from what I remember) so it all depends on how good I do on a specific project(s). 16 hour days, salary, lots of stress, etc. It's tempting because I work well under pressure, but also there are a few things that make me hesitant:

1. To become a PM I'd first have to become a PE(project engineer) and one of my coworkers who became a PE recently told me he took a pay cut down to 40 an hour. His insurance also isn't as good, aka not completely free every month like mine. When he's a PM he will be getting salary, but I'll have to adjust to a lower pay for a good long while, which is absolutely doable and fine because 40 an hour is plenty and I've thrived on it before, but it's a change, and I don't do well with change.

2. The salary doesn't seem that high? At least for the amount of stress it would cause. I haven't asked any employees directly about the pay but when I looked it up at this specific company it looks like 100k to 120k. Which is absolutely respectable and I'd be happy to have it but with no overtime pay and so many hours--it seems off. I know bonuses and commissions make up a lot of the pay so if I perform well I'll get plenty, from what I can tell, but I like the security of a high hourly wage.

3. I like working in the field. I enjoy detailing, but I like detailing something THEN making it. I know I can't do that forever, obviously. At the same time I envy the guys in the office. I want to be able to sit down and work on a computer instead of being in the heat or the rain. 

4. I might want to become a detailer instead. Another office job, but still union, and pays 12% more than the journeyman rate. I'd keep my excellent insurance and everything, and maybe there'd be less stress. 

The other thing is that I'm geared up to publish my novel. I originally wanted to go for traditional publishing, but I realized the surreal and interactive nature of the novel made it extremely difficult to market as a debut. I am considering a web serial instead, where I can control the pacing, the marketing, and still be able to get my work out there. But there's this lingering feeling in the back of my mind that if I manage to publish traditionally, I'll be able to make extra money, have a larger audience, and consider the possibility of retiring early, especially when combined with my high earnings at my day job. I'll be putting a lot of money into the project if I go for it on my own, which I'm willing to do, but there's the risk it fails completely and I waste all my time, effort, and cash. I suppose I should create a business plan for it at the very least.

"1645","2024-11-28",1732816845,"Should I Take the Severance or Promotion? ","Its been leaked to me ahead of time that my position in the company is being eliminated and restructured. I have options, but I dont know what the best course of action is. If you dont want the back story skip to the end. 

Backstory: tl;dr

Ive been with my current employer for 5.5 years.  We started as a very small sales team that grew very close over the years. Our team is now 6 total. We spend 10 hrs a day 4 days a week working together and frequently go out after work or meet up on our days off.  

My position is a support role for the sales people so the bottom rung of the hierarchy ladder, but crucial nonetheless.  I am the point of contact for all clients so even if their sales person is occupied I can still close the sale or handle any questions or concerns. I have excellent customer service with my specialty being difficult clients.  There are 2 people with this position on my team, 3 sales people, and 1 sales manager.

Right now I get 0.025% of commission for the sales I close which is lower than the sales rep, but my hourly wage is higher to accommodate.   

Over the last year both my manager and my OG coworker were promoted higher within the company so Im the last left of the original 3.  I dont like my new manager- she is new to the company and does not respect any of our experience- she thinks she knows better than us (which is her job ig), but I spend most of my day cleaning up her notes, educating her on our financing and/or best practices, and arguing with her what my job is because she wants me to do all the admin parts of her job on top of my job (this is relevant). 

The other new sales person is very aggressive with sales which is so different from our vibe that its a stark contrast in client experience.  Clients ask specifically to never have that salesperson again. This salesperson also takes frequent smoke breaks, complains in front of clients about staying late or working weekends, and overall is NOT a good fit for the team.   Not to mention they had to be told by HR it was inappropriate to date their clients >/ our current manager really likes that sales person while the rest of us cant stand either of them.

Last month the company froze hiring for my position. The company has historically offered generous severance packages so while Im anxious, Ive been content to wait and see.  

Last night my original manager (who is now a regional sales manager) asked me out to drinks after work to let me know it is official. My current position will be eliminated to create a new position of Assistant Sales Manager. No one is suppose to know outside of high ups yet, but since we are friends they wanted to give me a heads up.  

My friend/manager told me she would give me the new ASM position if I applied, but if I accept the position I forfeit the severance package.  

So- My Dilemma: 

The Severance: it is based on years employed so I would get either 3 or 4 months of pay (manager wasnt sure those details), plus pay out my 70 hrs of PTO, my remaining floating holidays, and my unused sick time. HR would also assist me in navigating applying for Unemployment. 
Basically I would have at least 4 months to look for another job.  
I have bills and a family to support, and live pay check to paycheck with only a little savings so being unemployed is very scary, but time off to find something new is also exciting. 
What if I cant find another job? Ive never been unemployed in my adult life. I have no college education and I dont even know where to start if I want something more than minimum wage. I havent updated my resume in 6 years =,

The Assistant Sales Manager Position: Its a lower salary by $200/per month with commission of 0.005% for TOTAL team sales. For reference our team regularly pulls in over $150,000 in total sales where I personally only close on average $15,000 of that.  So while the salary is lower, with the commission my take home pay should be higher. So technically a raise? 
Its also a title promotion.  Assistant Sales Manager looks better on paper than Sales Support Specialist. 
However! I would be working 5 days a week for 8 hours. My job would be exactly what I do now, plus all of the Sales Manager admin tasks that are my managers job right now, plus I would also be responsible for generating new sales of my own.  
So I would be working more days, with more responsibilities, and since I am still being laid off, I would be hired back as a new employee. No PTO, No floating Holidays, no seniority.   Id be starting all over again. 
Add in the fact I only like working with 3 people on my team and one of those people is being laid off with me.  The team is so close I dont anticipate the 2 remaining taking our layoff well.   What if they leave?  
If Im ultimately going to be working with all new people anyway would it be better to just find a new job?  

I feel like the safe option is the take the new position being offered& but Im worried that ultimately that will be the wrong choice in the long run.  I need an outside unbiased perspective 

What would you do?

I have been working at this customer service company for 1.5 years now that pays me good, etc. I was dealing with inbound calls and rotation shits for 8 months and now I'm doing chat support. The job is easy with fixed shifts and days off and also a support team but the metrics are so hard to achieve; as it will be the 9th month now for the team not achieveing the metrics. I haven't personally met the metrics for 3 months; and one thing that happened is that I decided to take an advice from the support team on a case that we don't really deal with and advised the customer with that I have been told accordingly; which made my boss go very frustrated as I did not advise of what she had told me to do (although she had no clue as well about this case as it is not something we offer help with); planned a meeting out of the blue with the HR to be told that if I did not meet the metrics, I will get fired. Although, this behavior should not be done as I should have had coaching sessions, deductions etc before treating to fire me! 

However, I slightly improved as my boss literally obligates one of the oldest co-workers to do a side by side investigation with me, which I am thankful for. But I still do not know if I should leave my notice without another job lined up instead of letting myself get fired (I swear I do my best!) or since she is helping me, she does not want me to get fired? I'm actually confused as I literally never felt happier when I was told that I might get fired lol as I'm very burnt out and need a break but at the same time I'm a bit worried about the finances although I have my savings that can cover me for more than 6 months and no bills to pay, honestly.

So should I take this as a break while applying for new jobs and actually focus on what I really want to do? I believe it will be better to leave than being terminated as I will be blacklisted if they terminated me and will not be able to work at the same company again if I ever wanted to. Also, where I live, there is no unemployment insurance.

X reports to senior management generally (of which I am a part).  X is an employee and is not part of senior management, although we gave X a senior title.  X changes jobs every 2-3 years.

X doesn't work much; X's total time working is far less than other people's time.  **The main issue, though, is that X flat-out refuses to help.**

\* When I ask X for help on a project, doing only the specific job that X was hired to do, X will respond, ""I am busy with family issues and existing projects.  I cannot help with your stuff.""

\* When we tell X that people junior to X could figure out the specific job that X was hired to do (since X claims to be too busy to do the specific job that X was hired to do), with some supervision by X, X will respond, ""I am busy with family issues and existing projects.  I cannot help with your stuff.""

X tells us that X has a sick spouse, and when X tells me (and others) that X cannot help by doing the specific job that X was hired to do, X reminds us of X's sick spouse.

When X is asked to do the specific job that X was hired to do:

\* X won't say, ""I'm backed up right now, but I can do this by next Thursday.""

\* X won't say, ""I'm backed up right now, but if you want to get a junior employee to handle this, I'm happy to supervise.""

\* X won't say, ""I'm backed up right now, but if there's something that I can do given that constraint, happy to do so.""

When asked to do the specific job that X was hired to do, X flat-out simply refuses to help.  A few members of senior management are angry about X's attitude and refusals to help when asked to do the specific job that X was hired to do, but others don't have a problem with it.

It's going to take a long time for what you're expecting especially since you're looking for remote work without any work experience but just keep trying. You're going to have to accept any entry level or even minimum wage to get your foot in the door. Most jobs nowadays rather hire someone with work experience now than just a college piece of paper.

In your situation having a Indeed, Glassdoor or LinkedIn account won't help much. I think the best option for you is to have a friend refer to a job. Good luck.","6"

I was in a similar boat, and I did end up going back to graduate school, which I am in now. I only went back because I needed that degree to get the licensure that I want (there is a big difference in pay in what I do between having that license and not having it). 

I am one of the oldest people in my graduate course. It definitely makes me feel left out sometimes, but I am also much better than my peers at understanding these concepts due to more life experiences. If whatever career you want doesnt require you to go back to school, I would advise against it. 

For work, most job opportunities depend on who you know. Network. Use the people that you already know now to get your foot in the door somewhere. At our age, it feels like we should be able to step into a higher position, but that just doesnt happen without work experience. You are probably going to get hired in at an entry position, and have to work your way up. You will just work your way up faster than others because you have more life experience, and the drive to not be stuck there as you age. 

I would even recommend, if you can afford it, volunteering at an organization you feel strongly about. I have gotten job offers from places that I have volunteered at, because it is hard to buy passion. An employer can offer money and perks, but those perks cant buy an employees passion for the organization. A volunteer obviously has that passion, and you just need to show how you can be valuable to the company without making yourself too available. On the downside, an offer of employment is not guaranteed. But it does look better on your résumé than doing nothing.","11"

Theres probably better ideas, thats just mine& to get something on your resume while you apply.  It takes awhile to find a job.

Also, try to reach out to womens organizations.  There are many online and in person trade shows and events.  Women in business.  Etc.  show up, make friends, and maybe you can get an entry level job.

Also think of anything to package onto your resume.  Stayed at home mom, volunteer work, church activities& hobbies.  You dont have much experience in the working world, so start looking to humanize yourself.","17"

Update Your Skills: Look into certifications relevant to fields you're interested in, such as digital marketing or project management, which can enhance your employability without needing a full degree.

Volunteer or Intern: Gaining experience through volunteer work can help fill gaps in your resume and demonstrate your commitment to learning.

Network: Connect with former classmates, friends, or local community groups to uncover job opportunities and seek referrals.

Apply for Entry-Level Positions: Focus on roles that require soft skills rather than specific experience, such as customer service or administrative support.

Consider Remote Work: Look for remote job opportunities that can accommodate your transportation limitations.

Its a tough spot to be in when youre looking for work after being out of the workforce for a while. But first off, you definitely *can* get your foot in the door even without a lot of direct work experience. A lot of employers value transferable skills like organization, communication, multitasking, and problem-solving. Sounds like you probably picked up a lot of those skills while managing a household, so dont sell yourself short.

As far as the whole going back to school thing, honestly, it depends. If youre considering a new direction, getting a certificate or a degree could open doors, but its not always necessary to land a decent job. Its more about what youre passionate about (or at least, what you think youd enjoy) and what fits with your lifestyle and health needs. If youre not sure yet, maybe look into some short-term certifications in areas like customer service, admin, or data entry. These types of roles often allow for remote work too, which could be a win if you're trying to avoid commuting.

Now, as for applying before updating your education, Id say why not? You might find an entry-level job that values your past experiences. I actually did something similar when I was making a career shift. I found that using an AI resume builder can be lots of help. In my case, Jobsolv helped me highlight the skills I had in a way that made me stand out more than just the plain old resume. Its a low-key way to make your experience look professional, even if its not directly in the field youre applying for.

Look for jobs that offer some flexibility, like virtual assistants, customer support roles, or remote admin work. Theyre often open to people with diverse backgrounds. And you can get a feel for the job market while figuring out what direction you want to go. Plus, if you dont mind doing a bit of entry-level work to start, it can give you some real-world experience while you explore your next step.

Dont get discouraged though. Just getting out there and applying will start building momentum. Good luck, Im sure youll find something that clicks. =L","19"

You could try via recruiters, and my biggest tip would be to call the manager/recruiter before you put your application in. I've found it really makes a difference. Just call them and ask some questions about the role, and then ask when they would be interviewing and say you're going to put your CV in later that day. I've actually gotten interviews booked doing this before I even sent them my CV. If you don't have any luck, or you decide you really want to do more training, why not get a certificate as an allied health assistant? A role where you will be employed for sure given it's in demand, and you only have to do a short certificate vs a full blown degree. ","42"

However, tomorrow is the last working day of the week that i can still talk to them about it - via call as we are working from home,  before they go PTO, for about 5 days (or even longer as there are times they extend their PTO). 

Would it be better to wait for their return to talk to them? Or is it better to do it via call? 

I dont really wish to spoil their mood before their PTO, but my concern is during the wait, the position may be filled even before I have the chance to interview for it. Another concern is, i think telling them before their PTO will leave a bad impression of me. 

Also, I'm kinda scared that if i were to break the news to them now, they might potentially block the transfer due to me telling them before they go on PTO and causing their mood to be affected before their PTO starts.","careerguidance",0,"https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1h1zsbh/internal_transfer_but_need_to_inform_manager_who/",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

What are some of the best (or worst) options when considering his career path/education (I realize some may vary by location, he may be open to US relocating, but he is currently in NC):

-Fair/decent or higher pay 
-B.A. or less needed
-No more than 40 hours a week
-Job competition that isn't crazy
-Job will be expected to still be in demand/needed for 10+ years

I'm 30 - was also in the IT field with no degree, got outsourced and discovered I had severe burnout. But I also don't value work in a way that it becomes the center of my world, so working 6-7 days and anything over 8 hours wasn't anything I had an interest in either.

Anyway, there are plenty of jobs you can get without a degree, or possibly an associates degree if you have the motivation to push through the 2 years. 

You could always do insurance estimation (cert), property management (cert/license), get into auto body or automotive electrical/tuning, any office administrator, management, customer service, or the likes. 

The hard part is finding out what you want to do exactly and how to break into that field, which ultimately comes down to you connecting with people in that field and getting contacts so you can have some form of reference. 

You should spend a couple hours researching careers that you can find on indeed and zip recruiter that don't require a degree or minimum of an associates, and look into them more on your own. We can't decide for you what to choose, but you have to find something that resonates with you and you can tolerate for another 30 years.","2"

Life gets overwhelming, and figuring out a career path when youre not fired up about anything is super tough. Honestly, it sounds like youre craving stability and something that doesnt drain your soul.

Community college could actually be a great option. A lot of programs there are short, affordable (sometimes free), and lead directly to solid jobs. Stuff like HVAC tech, medical billing, or even something chill like office admin work might be worth a look. These fields dont always need crazy-long hours or degrees and can give you that security youre looking for. You could also try talking to someone at the college. Career counselors there usually know their stuff and can help you narrow things down.

If youre really stuck, one thing that helped me was updating my resume to make my skills stand out even when I wasnt sure what I wanted. I used Jobsolv to pull it together because it made me see how my random jobs actually added up to something valuable. It wasnt a magic fix, but it gave me the confidence to apply for jobs I wouldnt have otherwise considered. And yeah, its good for making sure your strengths pop.

For now, just keep it simple. Look for roles that fit your vibe: decent pay, no brutal hours, and something you can grow into. You dont need to have your whole life mapped out, just the next step. Baby steps, man. Youll get there.","4"

It also helped me figure out how to position myself for jobs that were kind of out of my league because it made me see my work in a different light. Like, even stuff from delivery gigs or admin work had transferable skills I didnt think about before.

Its not just about slapping something together, either. It feels modern and legit, so your resume doesnt scream I used the same template as everyone else.

Before changing career to aviation, I worked as a software developer for a MNC but it was for very short time and the profile was completely different from ML. It was right after I finished four year university degree in computer science.

Considering all the latest revolution in the field of machine learning, it has sparked my interest to learn and implement the same even though its a long road. It will also help me diversify my knowledge and possibly help me earn if all goes well.

I have talked to some of my friends who are also women in stem and they are experiencing the same thing and want to switch careers. I'm at the point where I want to quit and aquire a job that is not my passion but I can have an acceptable wage to indulge in things I like to do outside of work. And have my passion for the environment and animals as a hobby through volunteer work on my free time. 
I feel as if I had to compete my entire professional life and I don't see that slowing down. I understand this field is really competitive but I thought it wouldn't be competitive once you get THE job. It's just exhausting. I'm not even excited for field season next year. I'm dreading it. I'm sick of the extra early mornings. I used to be so excited to get out there at 5am but now I'd rather do literally anything else. 
I have never had an official professional mentor throughout school and my career so I've been navigating this alone. I feel lost and confused. Looking for advice from someone who is willing to listen and has experiences they can share.

Back in 2021.. I appeared for my class 12th examination and NEET... I went straight to kota after my class 10th boards.. I always wanted to be a doctor.. And couldn't imagine myself in any profession other than that.. I was totally blindly obsessed with it...See I have been always good with my academics till class 10th..not because I worked hard.. It was because u know I was good in studies and could grasp concepts a bit quickly..i have been lazy my whole life.. It didn't impact me till 10th because it was all manageable and the syllabus are not that huge..but it started affecting me in NEET.. I realized.. It's all about hard work and it's something I really lack.. But obviously there was no giving up..Everytym I failed in NEET.. I blindly went for drops... I took two drop years.. And then got admitted to Delhi University.. And then thought of a partial drop.. Here comes the jolt.. My first sem exams got missed due to hepatitis and then my second sems got missed because I went home to appear for NEET...Here I got a year back because of that.

After that I really got depressed.. And there were full of regrets.. In my last drop year it was challenge for me everyday to get up and study for the full day 
. I eventually did it... But of course I couldn't gave my best due to the laziness factor.. I missed the cut off for few marks..And this tym when I got some decent marks.. There was this scam of NEET and the cut offs were too high. I m repeating my first year again.. My all friends are graduated and I m still on first year.. I m 22 and still on first year
. Damn this really hurts sometimes.. How good of a student I used to be and here I m. 

I m right now pursuing zoology hons.. I don't know what my future gonna look like. I probably might do an MBA.. My mba resume also not gonna look good having a year back plus to drop years..but this is the last hope.. 
Sometimes I hear that people who stay lazy always end up getting lazy in lyf.. They don't really change.. I hope this is not true..
Today as I turn 22..i look back and just think of getting my years back.. I know this is not possible.. I know I cannot chnge my past and should work hard again.. But this is how I feel sometimes.. 
 
I m all ears to receive all kinds of ur suggestion/ personal stories/ academic comeback/ recommendations etc etc.. 

I know this is not much related to the sub.. But I feel members here have seen lyf and are more mature compared to me and can relate or share their own story.

3. I want to start my own car business like repair, tuning and so on. I have zero experience in this field. I know that i will love this business. For starting the Bussiness i don't even have that much money. Suggest me how to make money.

Buck is the VP of operations for the company that bought us out.  Having a new boss is nothing new to me as the company was purchased from my original employer nine years ago and during those years, I had six different bosses as we went through several corporate CEOs and each tried various ways of structuring management.  While this facility is in the south, for as long as Ive been there, the facility has always been owned by a corporate entity somewhere up north (Chicago, Oak Brook, and now Detroit).

I am the only person at the facility that took a pay cut (20%) when the recent acquisition was finalized.  That may have been a red flag, but Buck assured me that at the GM level the bonus structure would more than make up for the reduction in base.  I asked how that bonus was determined, but the answer is still pending.  I am generally patient and generous with things like this as I know things get forgotten and people are people, if my gut says the intent is genuine, I give the benefit of the doubt.

Two weeks ago, we started up a new ERP, one that the new owners use.  If youve ever been part of getting a new ERP going, you know how that can affect all aspects of operations.  This past Wednesday Buck called me and was frustrated that Id planned for a crew to come in this weekend (Saturday) on overtime to get us caught up on work and he'd just found out about it at the last moment from HR (I had previously confirmed with HR what the OT rate would be given that it was a holiday weekend).  This surprised me as I thought these sort of decisions were under the GM's scope of authority.  I am generally adaptable, however, and figure this is fine, I can run matters of OT by my boss in the future.  I let him know how I came to the decision on OT but then his demeanor went from mild frustration to outright furious. I got the sense that he didn't appreciate me responding at all and now he wasnt giving me any space to speak, and a laundry list of grievances began to pour out.

As the list of my ""fuck-ups"" went on, some things were repeated and began to stand out for me.  First, a bit of background, this isnt the first acquisition this company has made in the region. About two years ago, they bought another facility about 100 miles north of us, and the GM of that facility, we can call him Benny, was brought up multiple times as the shining example that Im failing to live up to.  Buck says that Benny calls him four or five times a week and runs all the major decisions by him and he would never have overtime weekend without consulting Buck.  Also, hes upset that I havent established a relationship with Benny.  I start to get the impression that Buck really expected me to be a Benny clone.

Another thing stood out to me as he repeatedly said, I am not going anywhere! and This isnt ACME!! (fake name of previous company).  That kind of hurt because everyone has been extremely positive about the acquisition and were happy to be beyond Acme's money problems.  As he emphasized this point, he also made it clear that I needed to think hard about whether I was on the same page as him because he has no use for someone who isnt. ""You can get with the program or you'll be looking for another job.""  Ive always felt like this sort of thing goes without saying and so it started to feel like an intimidation or bullying tactic.

Buck continues to throw one thing after another that hes upset about in my face, things that hadnt previously been discussed as problems.  I assume he was pissed that we hadnt discussed, as he also repeated over and over that my communication is shit.  Ive experienced countless course corrections over my career.  Im not perfect and Im always open to improvement and adjusting my approach to just about anything.  That said, Ive never been yelled at in such an unprofessional manner; but perhaps Ive just been lucky?

So, Ive had this cloud over me through all of Thanksgiving and I have so many thoughts.  At first, I felt shame for some reason, like Id been doing wrong and now someone was finally calling me out on it. Then I started to reflect on some of the big points Buck was making and started to feel like hes just pissed that Im not a Benny clone.  Then I started to feel like if I put up with being treated like this, I have no self-respect.  Am I being naive?  Should I stick around and continue adapting while staying true to myself and force Buck to fire me?  Should I just put in my notice and move on?  Buck said he would follow up with me on Monday to see if I was on board or not, if I was with the program.

Is it finally time to move on? While I'm confident I could figure something out, I'm not sure where I would go or what I would do. I'd be saying goodbye to a low six-figure salary, which is pretty good in my area.  Feeling very conflicted.","careerguidance",2,"https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1h2w52y/is_it_finally_time_to_move_on/","flowerpatch18","2024-11-29",1732922031,2,2,0,0,"I dont know how to deal with Buck, but I want to say in my opinion, its better to leave on your own terms rather than be pushed out by Bucks behavior - that is leave when you have an alternative option if you do decide to leave.

My undergrad was in business management and most of my 3-4 years of work experience was in Business Development and Project management. 

Now, I did some research to find that having a project portfolio goes a long way in a situation like mine but I want to know how do I go about choosing what type of projects I wanna do? Like should I base it off on the type of industry I wanna work in (eg: finance as a data analyst) but then again I dont want to confine myself to one sector as I feel it would lower my odds of getting a data related job in some other industry if an opportunity were to come by. I am genuinely confused and some advice would be much appreciated. Any more tips and suggestions in terms of bettering my chances of landing a job are also welcome. Thank you in advance. 

PS - I am an international living in the UK so my all my work experience (except for part time jobs) are based outside of the UK. ","careerguidance",0,"https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1h2vvrh/any_advice/",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Yea, that's not a world view that's really consistent with success in big tech. You ply your craft on a very big team, with lots of indirection, and serve a monolith that makes decisions on lives of people without any personality. You can't get caught up in all the what if scenarios of ""poor collective outcomes in the long run"".

Be a soldier, and do your f'ing job, especially when it sucks, because it's something worth doing.  If there's enough in that job that you enjoy doing or find fulfillment in, helping people along the way, and building things that people use, you can thread a needle of meaning through the sea of bullshit.

That's sort of my view: I'm a builder. I make things and help people do the same. If you pay me, I'll make things for you, and you're problems will become my problems for hopefully no more than 40 hours a week. You can't both reject the system, and benefit from serving that system with a 300k per year job.

My main hangups are the poor compensation compared to cost of living in my area and the notion (again created by capitalism) that the success metric of education is college admission and eventual vocational success. I worry I would feel strange to be preparing kids to ace their courses and exams and follow a path of academic achievement that I once did, considering that path ends up in a place I ended up hating. Almost pyramid scheme like. That being said I know that's not all there is to teaching, and I do find appeal in the aspects of mentorship and pushing students to develop confidence / take on new challenges. I do find the academic incentives and rigid frameworks pushed on kids to be often directly at odds with fostering a love of learning though. My past teachers were often vocal about their frustration with this and their lack of freedom to teach as they saw fit.","10_1"

How do I recover my hope and motivation?","I was previously working as a software engineer since graduating from college. I gradually became extremely disillusioned with work. I ended up quitting two jobs due to this. I got to low points in both of them where I couldn't get myself to do my job. (Before anyone asks, all other parts of my life are generally sound and satisfactory: I exercise daily, have a great family, friends, and partner, and have creative and engaging hobbies). I enjoy personal growth and also helping others. I ended up joining a math degree program full time for now while I'm between jobs which I am enjoying, but I am well aware that all paths there also lead to the same conundrums of work opportunities that I will detail below.

Friends and former colleagues suggested different avenues like startups as I only worked at large tech companies, but I find most startups to also be working on projects that are not really moving the needle on important issues, or worse, moving the needle in dangerous directions. My real issue is with the overall structure of work and capitalism. I can't find any hope in it. We are not working toward any collective goal like eventually reducing work overall and increasing everyone's prosperity while also maintaining the health of the environment. It is very individualistic and therefore it feels like there is no incentive to do more than the bare minimum. The system's individual incentives create behavior that converges toward at best neutral and at worst very poor collective outcomes in the long run. I would feel much more motivated to go to work every day if I felt that if I work hard, I can create some collective benefit (even if it is for a small collective) rather than just individual benefit with potentially serious negative externalities.

Unfortunately, this collection of attitudes leads me to doing the bare minimum which nowadays is not sufficient at any corporate software job let alone as a new hire. Previously I was always a hard worker and unfortunately it seems I don't have the middle gear between working relatively diligently and not working at all. Yet I can't find the ""relatively diligent"" gear again.

Soon enough though I will need to figure out how to move on or else I risk loitering while burning my savings down for too long. I am seeking advice from people who have dealt with similar issues.

"1886","2024-11-29",1732913715,"People who started software development and got disappointed  how did you deal with it?","Hi, I just wanted to share some thoughts about my current work situation because I assume many are in a similar position (especially when it comes to software development jobs), and Id like to hear how others have dealt with it.

I got a masters in mechanical engineering + masters in product design since I have always been interested in creativity / innovation / product management. But I have taken many courses and an intense bootcamp in development (among other things). **I did this since I thought I would be a good fit for software development for various reasons, mainly because Ive always been interested in computers/logic/math, I like diving deep into topics, and I enjoy structure.** 

**But it turns out I was completely wrong about the idea that software development is structured. My experience is that its extremely messy; broadly speaking:** 

\- Sooner or later, you always end up in large projects where an enormous amount of code has been written, much of it by other developers, many of whom have left or made quick-fix solutions that make the code painful to understand. The code is too extensive to go through entirely, so youre stuck just learning enough to handle the specific task youre working on right now.

\- Its almost impossible to set concrete, measurable goals because its so hard to estimate how long things will take  at any moment, you can get stuck for three days on an unexpected bug that pops up.

I feel mentally drained from constantly only understanding a tiny part of what Im working on and not being able to have measurable goals.

On top of that, Id really like to work in teams where youre not just sitting alone but actively collaborating with others. In the long term, Im thinking I could work as some kind of project manager/system architect where I wouldnt be coding, but right now, I dont see a clear path to get there. Ive got about two years of experience, but I feel so drained from my current job that I barely have the energy to apply elsewhere, and Im not even sure what roles to look for.

So, Im guessing there are many in a similar position  i.e., who for various reasons have ended up dissatisfied with software development. How have you handled it? Do you have any tips for what to do in this kind of situation?

Unfortunately, as you mentioned, education is not really valued as a society, which then makes educating young minds a more monumental task. Additionally, social media has reduced the attention spans of children significantly, which makes it even more difficult. Instant gratification is hard to compete with. Beyond this, the general behavior problems in class can derail the flow of class and those feelings of success.

Teaching takes a special breed of amazing human, and at this point, I am not sure I am that person. I dream of a job that I can clock out of and really not worry about doing anything until my next shift. While CSR might not be a noble profession, this role is in an educational company that makes pretty decent quality materials to educate students. The company was also formed by teachers and looks for teachers to fill it's ranks.

The last two years I worked at a ski resort in the Winter in California, and then freelance/tour guide in the summer. 

Every summer I kept on saying once I get a full time job that I wont go back to the ski resort and live in nyc permanently.

Now I got a full time job here and in a dilemma. This is for a Korean company and all the company meetings are in Korean and the people who work there speak limited English. I have worked here 3 weeks now and have also told my boss about my sturggles and will often try to include me by speaking English and reminding people to speak in English, but all I hear at the office is 99% Korean. The commute is also an hour and a half everyday and is making me despise going to work every morning. 

Now, all I think about is going back to the ski resort to my previous life. I had freedom, a team that valued me. Technically, hourly, the pay is the same but the full time job has benefits like pto that the ski resort doesnt have. I loved my job at the resort but thought that I needed to grow up and get a full time job and be closer to home. One reason why I wanted a full time job was to get pro and travel more since thats what I want to do most.

At the resort, I get to ski on my days off and during breaks. I live on mountain so the office is just a 5 minute walk. The vibes are so chill that it never feels like Im working a day in my life there. I enjoy going to work. Im really contemplating going back. Every year, its been chaotic and of course times I hated it, but there was never a dull moment and really felt like I wasnt wasting my life there. 

Is it dumb that I want to quit this stable corporate job to a seasonal job? Im afraid when I want a full time job that no one will want to hire me, and if I get rid of my apartment in nyc, Ill never be able to live in nyc. I dont have any debts or family in America.

TLDR; Small fish in big global pond or big fish in much smaller newer pond that wants too be a bigger pond


Working in a role for 9 years where Ive learned my trade advising clients on their  personal finances. 

Today Ive been asked by the head of a company to have a chat on Monday about a possible role for me at their place should I be interested& the meetings been arranged for Monday AM over a coffee beside their offices. 



Current Role

Top tier firm where Ive been since the start and progressed through the ranks. Now theoretically one level behind the head of the team who essentially oversees all work but gives me a good level of autonomy. Im on a comfortable salary but who doesnt want more in any situation. Ive got a good year of work behind me and a very strong pipeline of work going into 2025. 


Potential New Role

Smaller form and I would be brought in as a Director to help them build up the team in the specific niche I specialise in. They dont have much footing in  the space yet but are wanting to develop it as they see it as a key growth area. From a public perception, could be seen as a downgrade&. 



So Im looking after some advice on what I should do or maybe more of what should I ask the company on Monday. A set of questions that would be key would be great!

What kind of funding is available to build this new practice? You don't want to get there and find out you have no budget. 

What are the long term goals and strategy for the company and is the area you're being brought in for a prominent party of that strategy? If not, ongoing funding may be questionable. 

What is the structure of the team you'll be working with? How big is the team, who does it report to, will you be managing people? Are you responsible for hiring people and if so, is the budget for doing so confirmed?

"1927","2024-11-29",1732909856,"Does Env. sustainability and green tech or Medical engineering (tissue) offer better career prospects?","Hi all, I recently finished my undergrad in Natural Sciences (mainly biology/health sciences based with a couple of modules around env science thrown in) and have received 2 offers to study MSc's in Medical Engineering (Cell and Tissue) and Environmental Sustainability and Green Tech.

I am agonising over deciding which path to follow next as I feel once I choose one route or the other I am pretty much pursuing that scientific field in terms of future academia and career (forever).

My current thought process is this (verbal diarrhoea incoming):

I have always been interested in medical science and the molecular chemistry involved in disease, its treatment and drug development and having studied a module in infectious disease at undergrad i was keen to pursue this avenue.

The tissue engineering side of medical engineering grabbed me instantly due to its sci fi nature and frankly astonishing advancements and innovation - I mean bioprinting heart valves in a lab - prettyyyy crazy.

I also enjoyed studying some env. science modules due to the inherent problem solving approach to some of Earth's biggest challenges and felt this was suited to my philosophical and strategic mindset in terms of being able to present arguments/viewpoints about how to effectively consider/design/implement solutions to pressing issues of climate change, food security and loss of biodiversity - real big picture stuff.

So ultimately, my decision comes down to prospects following each Master's course.

Environmental sustainability and green tech feels like the big picture, trendier option with more versatility in terms of working in a variety of industries and there seems to be higher demand and roles/grad places when looking on job sites. I also feel like there'd be more opportunities to travel and with accreditation maybe more potential to one day work independently as a consultant.

Negatives - It doesn't excite me as much as the medical field and I feel like atm any tom, dick and harry is pushing into the env. sustainability/green jobs space.

Tissue engineering is much more specialized and small scale in terms of potential employment opportunities. The course content sounds fascinating and medical biology is my first love BUT I am terrified going down this avenue would be naive.

Firstly, in terms of potential roles out there, from a few searches on job sites it appears there isn't that much to go around, especially given the vast numbers of graduates in biomedical sciences/engineering etc and entry level positions are surprisingly low paying (23k per year!?!?)

Secondly, I worry that even if I do find a role I could just end up being a research scientist stuck at a lab bench for the rest of my life with a max earnings of 40k per year in what is actually a highly skilled role.

Thirdly, I worry that even though my MSc would be specialised, companies wouldn't recognise me due to my BSc in a broad based subject (Natural Sciences) and are more likely to hire experienced people with a good BSc grounded in the field.

So I'd be really grateful if people in biotech/pharma/medical devices could give me a heads up as to whether I have any real prospects going forward or is the best I could do being stuck as a low level worker drone in the lab?

And I'd be equally grateful if Env. Sustainability grads/consultants could let me know if the job really is all that and if it offers all the opportunities and independence companies like WSP say it does on their grad scheme ads?

Its also a versatile degree that pairs well with certifications or further specialization later. After finishing, you can explore Rad Tech programs, which would align with your interest in healthcare and offer solid pay with a manageable schedule. The key imo is to complete your B.S. first to avoid leaving unfinished degrees, which can be a red flag for some employers.

In the meantime, you could also look into entry-level remote roles in customer support, tech support, or admin that might not require extensive experience but can help ease your financial burden.

"1956","2024-11-29",1732905926,"How do I bouce back from being fired from a toxic work environment? Was I exploited?","I was a content writer for a holding company that owns multiple media firms. Started as an intern in March 2024. Left after a month. 

Reasons:

- He kept prying into my personal life, especially after finding out I had a boyfriend. Everytime he called he asked me ""How my Romeo was?"" Felt icky.
- Constantly badmouthed my colleagues in front of me. Called the women pumpkin headed.
- Asked me to supervise a colleague who was my senior, creating unnecessary animosity.  
- Called anyone who disagreed with him an idiot"".
- Micromanaged everything: I had to notify him even for breaks or that I am working remote even though I had the right to do that. The work was hybrid.
- Yelled over trivial things. Once, in a meeting, I was on mute and took a few seconds to unmute (normal lag). He snapped: If youre not interested in working, why join the meeting? Dont waste my time.  
- Claimed our behavior was abhorrent and unprofessional regularly.  

So, I quit. Good riddance. Got into one of the top schools in Indiafelt like I was moving on. Then, this same manager offers me a part-time writing job at another company. Said I was a good writer and could become an editor someday. Seemed promising. 

My role? One article a day, every day also on weekends, for $201/month (¹17k)manageable for a student. But within a month, a new manager started assigning me 2-3 articles daily. When I brought up my contract, he complained to the old manager, who *blasted* me for talking to a senior like that. Said my salary would increase if I worked harder.

So, I was basically doing full-time work (5 PM to 12-1 AM after classes) for part-time pay. Writing scientific articles, no lesschallenging, since Im from a humanities background. Mistakes? No tolerance. They didnt care about my struggles.

Then, they transferred me back to *that* toxic manager without warning. First day back? He called me bullshit for saying 2500-3000 words a day isnt feasible without AI. Set up a Google Doc, gave access to all supervisors, and monitored my work anonymously. Demanded I write five articles a week to earn weekends off. No flexible hours. I asked for a 9-5 schedule since Im a studenthe refused. Apparently it was too difficult for him, but I am a content writer how can it be difficult? Apart from giving me me daily topics I mean my presence should matter nothing to u.

The worst part? I was still being paid part-time wages for this full-time circus. 

Atlast thought of talking to the hr about all these. The hr was super supportive until he wasn't. 

Yesterday he egged me on into telling me how what I was facing was completely intolerable and then today after he had the meet with this manager everything changed.

Some hours ago he called he didn't find anything on this particular manager and whatever I said didn't line up.

Reasons:

- He kept prying into my personal life, especially after finding out I had a boyfriend. Everytime he called he asked me ""How my Romeo was?"" Felt icky.
- Constantly badmouthed my colleagues in front of me. Called the women pumpkin headed.
- Asked me to supervise a colleague who was my senior, creating unnecessary animosity.  
- Called anyone who disagreed with him an idiot"".
- Micromanaged everything: I had to notify him even for breaks or that I am working remote even though I had the right to do that. The work was hybrid.
- Yelled over trivial things. Once, in a meeting, I was on mute and took a few seconds to unmute (normal lag). He snapped: If youre not interested in working, why join the meeting? Dont waste my time.  
- Claimed our behavior was abhorrent and unprofessional regularly.  

So, I quit. Good riddance. Got into one of the top schools in Indiafelt like I was moving on. Then, this same manager offers me a part-time writing job at another company. Said I was a good writer and could become an editor someday. Seemed promising. 

My role? One article a day, every day also on weekends, for $201/month (¹17k)manageable for a student. But within a month, a new manager started assigning me 2-3 articles daily. When I brought up my contract, he complained to the old manager, who *blasted* me for talking to a senior like that. Said my salary would increase if I worked harder.

So, I was basically doing full-time work (5 PM to 12-1 AM after classes) for part-time pay. Writing scientific articles, no lesschallenging, since Im from a humanities background. Mistakes? No tolerance. They didnt care about my struggles.

Then, they transferred me back to *that* toxic manager without warning. First day back? He called me bullshit for saying 2500-3000 words a day isnt feasible without AI. Set up a Google Doc, gave access to all supervisors, and monitored my work anonymously. Demanded I write five articles a week to earn weekends off. No flexible hours. I asked for a 9-5 schedule since Im a studenthe refused. Apparently it was too difficult for him, but I am a content writer how can it be difficult? Apart from giving me me daily topics I mean my presence should matter nothing to u.

The worst part? I was still being paid part-time wages for this full-time circus. 

Atlast thought of talking to the hr about all these. The hr was super supportive until he wasn't. 

Yesterday he egged me on into telling me how what I was facing was completely intolerable and then today after he had the meet with this manager everything changed.

"1968","2024-11-29",1732905255,"How to apply for a Job (tips)?","**How many Jobs should should I apply to?**

If you decide to just apply to 1000 job listings with the same resume and cover letter, or maybe you apply even without a cover letter - you will not get interviews or jobs. Instead, you should apply to anywhere from 3-10 job listings at once, customising your resume and cover letter for each particular role,. Make sure you write a cover letter and resume, highlighting problem solving skills, social skills, time efficiency, [other relevant skills to the role], and past work experience or even if you are young and havent worked you can just put down lessons youve learnt from informal experiences that you can show are transferable to the job.

**Do I need a cover letter?**

Make sure you write a cover letter, employers sometimes throw out applications that dont have cover letters, my boss/owner actually told me he does this. Keep the cover letter short, have zero grammatical mistakes, these small mistakes show employers you dont pay attention to detail and maybe that you rushed through your application because you didnt care enough, this will almost definitely send your application to the trash can.

**What should my resume look like?**

1. Your resume should be max 1 A4 page long, potentially you could have 2 pages but absolutely not, unless its a graduate level role that requires extra information. Even so, employers get hundreds of resumes, and dont want to read 2 pages - they could throw it away for that reason.

2. Do not make your text small just to fit everything, this will just annoy whoever is reading your resume. I recommend using Word or google docs - the online resume makers are what everyone uses and trust me when I say, employers notice if you used an online template to do the work for you; another way to get sent to the trash can. 

3. Include all your information, address, name, phone number, email.

4. If possible, hand in your resume in person, I know a lot of businesses have moved to online uploading of applications but most do accept physical copies. It shows a level of care and genuine interest in the role. 



**Important**

When addressing your cover letter/resume, try not to write To whom it may concern. 

I understand you dont know who exactly will be reading your application, so you should call the company and ask the name of the hiring manager or person that reviews applications. Then you have their name and you can write

 *Dear [hiring manager / recruiters name]* 
This shows an attention to detail, hard work, politeness, and many other skills that employers love. Plus, almost no one does this because they apply to 1000 jobs using the same tired method that gets their application thrown out. 

If you do not know the name of he hiring manager or you failed to find out, just address as:

*Dear [company name] Hiring Manager*

A hiring manager isnt going to read a 10 page resume, NO MATTER HOW WELL IT IS WRITTEN! 1 page, 1 page, 1 page!!!!!!!! I know you think youre Charles dickens writing how good you are but the hiring manager doesnt give a f. They want short sharp and shiny so they dont have to waste time.

Thats about it, you should look at some resume and cover letter exemplars online as well for reference. Good luck on the hunt!

I guess I had trouble adapting to the modern woman role and grew up seeing my mom in a very trad. house wife role. (absolutely nothing wrong with this but I feel like i'm holding myself back trying to be sweet and nice to everyone) when I do have this assertive side. I know this post may seem silly but it's how I've been feeling. I also feel ashamed to be unleash that strong side bc of being perceived as ""masculine/aggressive"" I would like to honor these traits I have because I do respect it when I see it an other women and I get it.

Not all management positions are a good fit for very assertive people.  I've realized I can't manage low performing people, although I'm great at managing and directing processes and motivating/leading high performers.  I recently had a 3rd interview for an administrative position I was a very good fit for - except my communication style is too direct for the personalities of some of the people I would have been managing.  All the other aspects of the position seemed like a perfect fit, but there are low performers who would have been under me and the corporation can not afford to lose them.  During the interview, when presented with the question of how I would counsel those employees without driving them away, I was at a complete loss.

I think we need positions that involve going into battle, not positions that involve nurturing in any way.  I've often been told I would have made a great marine.","7"

Im due August, so really thinking ahead here. Im working on my Masters degree (public administration) but have more than a year left.

I currently work a decent security job with good hours and benefits, but I dont really want to go back to it once I give birth; theres no WFH option and Id have to send my baby to daycare 4 days a week, which is hardly justifiable on my partner and Is incomes.

I am open to picking up weekend security gigs (ie concerts and events) since I already have connections and relevant experience for those jobs, and they typically offer a lot of flexibility. However, I would love to find an online gig I can do part-time/free lance as well. Security isnt really what I want to do the rest of my life, so any role that will help get me experience to eventually transition in another field would be ideal. 

Most of my working experience is in security and I have a year of supervisory experience. I tend to do best in the realms of administrative, communication and educational/training realms even if I havent had formal job titles in those fields. I was a supervisor for a year, which involved formal report writing, scheduling, training, coaching, etc. Im fairly confident both writing and speaking, and work well with others. Ive done a decent amount of volunteer work, primarily related to museums and education. 

What sort of jobs, sites, fields should I look into? Im very open to getting a certification or two. As a graduate student, learning something new and having to test doesnt scare me if I have time to study. 

Things Im interested in or have thought about: education, law, public safety, healthcare admin, insurance, cybersecurity, general government administration support

Definitely not interested in: law enforcement or high clearance security jobs, armed security

Remote is a location, not a job field. You need to be looking at specific jobs and then see if they have a remote option. No one can tell you what job you have the skills for.

2. From one mom to another, WFH is WORK and extremely difficult to watch kids, especially depending on the company you work for. Chances are you will not have the flexibility to do both. 

3. To make a career pivot, chances are you will need to start as entry level which is difficult to find WFH options and has an insane amount of work for very little pay.

4. I would suggest finding a 1099/commissions only job (sales, recruiting, etc) that you can fully pick your hours and have the flexibility to watch your baby and WFH. This just means you will have to rely on other resources for your benefits like M/D/V etc.","1"

Hard skills would be things like report-writing, building newsletters, developing and implementing training programs, scheduling, presenting/public speaking, navigating security systems such as cameras and alarms. Im totally open to certifications to develop more specific hard skills.

Softer skills are patience, working well with a wide range of people (ie, everyone from museum directors to music industry folks), communication, attention to detail.

My work experience is mainly in security, though Ive worked in education via Americorps and through an internship. My security jobs have mainly been in museums and concert venues. These are typically hands-off, unarmed gigs that require attention to detail and customer service more than physical security. I was a supervisor for a year until mass layoffs at a former job. Ive also volunteered in museums as a tour guide and event assistant, and recently helped review grant applications with a different department at my current job.","1_1_1_1"

Im due August, so really thinking ahead here. Im working on my Masters degree (public administration) but have more than a year left.

I currently work a decent security job with good hours and benefits, but I dont really want to go back to it once I give birth; theres no WFH option and Id have to send my baby to daycare 4 days a week, which is hardly justifiable on my partner and Is incomes.

I am open to picking up weekend security gigs (ie concerts and events) since I already have connections and relevant experience for those jobs, and they typically offer a lot of flexibility. However, I would love to find an online gig I can do part-time/free lance as well.

"1991","2024-11-29",1732903076,"What should I do? ","26M, I want to pivot to a higher base paying commissions based job. 

I am currently studying accounting, I have roughly two years left. I am currently working a new sales job, large company and I specialize in large accounts (hr/saas), 6m in Ive just barely got out of training and have been making pennies on the dollar. I like sales, but I would like to move to a more vibrant city, Im thinking a higher base and a WFH sales manager position could give me the financial freedom to find somewhere to settle, for context Im west coast in a retirement city with low cost of living. I have banking experience with a very large bank and also account receivable experience. I could make crazy money at my current job with the commission structure but my quality of life is seemingly diminishing. I would easily reposition my career to live somewhere else, the commission structure suits me as I have more drive to create my own future. I dont mind going back to salary but Im worried Im not qualified for what id like to be payed salaried. 

So my ask is, with a financial background, sales and banking, together maybe 7-8 working experience, degree pending, POC, not that it should matter but for context, what job opportunities could give me better financial freedom. Titles or departments to aim for if not sales related would help. Lastly I love the repetitiveness of the AR job process as my experience was repetitive tasks since im balancing school and want to grow as a person I need a great work/life balance.

You are right that devoting more time to finding a job with the same resume will likely get you better results. But you gotta realize that the added work experience actually helps a lot with finding a better job. Almost nobody starts out in their desired end position unless you have a very specific degree for it. 

I'm actually currently in a similar boat and I chose to take the lackluster job and just job search in my downtime. I think it was definitely worth it for my specific circumstances. If you believe you're qualified enough to get the job you want now in a reasonable time frame then sure go for it, but the job market is rough right now and many people (both workers and future hiring managers) believe any job is better than no job. Even if it's a completely unrelated field, it gets you a paycheck and shows you're willing to work and can hold a job. 

Also I don't know what field you're trying to get into, but if you do end up quitting (which is a valid option) and it's applicable to your field, you should look into spending some of your time to get certifications that will help your resume.","1_1_1"

So depending on how you look at it you'd be between 3 and 7 years ahead of me.  Not that I'm any kind of gold standard for an optimal career trajectory, but I am proof you can make a decent life for yourself even if you didn't follow the prescribed plan.

Sometimes surviving gets in the way of preparing for the future.  Sometimes the future just seems really far away and you think you have time, then all of a sudden you're 27 and questioning what to do next.

I sure as fuck didn't know what I wanted to do at 18 when I got out of high school.  I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life when I dropped out of college when I was 22.  I survived the rest of my 20s with the love and support of my family and friends.  Started a family (wife and 1 kids when I went back to school at 30).  Graduated at 34 (with 2 more kids) and have done progressively better (Again with a lot of help and support from family and friends).  

I still don't know what the fuck I'm doing, but I look a lot better on paper at 50 than my 20 year old self would have thought.  

I can look back and wish I'd finished school the first time.  I can think I'd be better off financially, if I had waited to have kids until after I was started in a career.  I can look back and easily question everything I've done and all the choices I've made and what it all comes back to, for me, is what can I do to make my life better today.  

If you can start a career at 27, don't wait until you're 28.  If you're not ready for a career at 27, then do what you need to make it until 28, and check your options again.  Whatever you do, don't beat yourself up over the past (I did that for a while) and don't try to change the past - it won't work.","33"

I am skinny and I want to build myself better (not like too try hard but just better and strong as a normal athlete and a senior karateka). Also I used to do running even in 11th I did but our school doesn't allow to participate in sports for 12th graders and so with lack of time and practice all detoriated. If I take drop my next year will be doomed studying for this. Ichoosec science cus I liked it the most and I also watched videos of higher studies back during covid in 8th 9th . Like 4d, string theory, event horizon swartzchildrradius, singularity etc. I could explain 4d back then but now ig I can but not better than before. I just want to join a good college which doesn't charge that much as I don't come from a rich background so I don't want my parents to struggle more even in this age. They are turning old. Also I have familyi issues my  parents did love marriage but it didn't go wellswhatever that's a different story. 
Sorry i yapped a lot and went out of the question

Sometimes i think Id be more satisfied with something pursing something related to my degree or something for office style. I wouldnt even know where to look.

"2082","2024-11-29",1732898434,"Should I lie about my problems?","I will try to explain my situation first before asking questions:

I have a degree and completed an apprenticeship before studying. My focus during my studies was software development. I worked for a company in this field while studying and for another company after studying, but I hated it.
Sitting in a room with teammates, not having a real conversation for almost a day, and having nothing to ""look"" at by the end of the day, at least most of the time, was not something I enjoyed. I was simply unable to ""connect"" to it.
I'm simply not enjoying software development when the whole day revolves around it. I'm not good at it, so let's just say I know some basics.

What I like is system administration, and what I'm currently really interested in as well is cybersecurity. However, I haven't worked in either field for the past eight years. I've mainly used my free time to educate myself on these topics, so I definitely lack practical knowledge.

There have been some medical issues that forced me to quit my job. Currently, I still have some medical issues that need to be fixed but time runs by...
I'm trying to educate myself as best as I can, but I'm feeling ""cornered.""

These are the current issues: money, job, and future. Do I have to get a job and do something I clearly don't enjoy doing, or should I keep trying to somehow find a job doing the things I like?

There is an increasing pressure day by day. Am I simply ""wasting"" my time and should stop it asap and do any job there is?

Maybe I shouldn't be complaining, but I'm really at a loss here.

My vita isn't of interest to companies because I clearly lack experience in the fields, and I understand that. At the end of the day, there are people out there who are more experienced in those fields, so they hire those people instead of me.

It reflects poorly that I have also been out of a job due to my medical issues. Why would someone take the chance of hiring someone who might get sick again for an extended period?

There's another thing I need to mention: after studying, I moved far away from my hometown and felt lost and isolated. I missed my family and friends. Sure, I could have created a new ""circle"" there, but somehow I couldn't. That might sound ""stupid"" to many of you, but that's how things went. Somehow, I'm just not able to cope with a completely different surrounding.

My problems might sound quite elitist to some, and I understand that. So feel free to tell me.


Questions:

How should I proceed? Should I continue trying to educate myself and somehow get into those fields?

Should I change my attitude and simply accept some things as they are?

What would be a reasonable approach that could enhance my success?

Would it be better not to talk about the medical issues in the past? How should I talk about the problems?

What to do?","I work in communications for a small company, specifically in social media, building brand awareness and promoting products. The work is fine. I've been doing this for over three years (one year at my current job). I like it, Im good at it, but its not always exciting to be honest.

The challenge I sometimes face is my manager. Hes one of the kindest, most inclusive people Ive ever metthoughtful, patient, and genuinely interested in our teams well-being. However, hes not great at managing or understanding our field. Hes 55, worked as a journalist for most of his life, and this is his first managerial role. I feel as if I didn't have mentor at all, I feel that I am the one doing all the teaching.

He occasionally micromanageswants to be CCd on every email and included in everything. Hes also sometimes socially awkward, struggles to read the room, speaks slowly, and often rambles, so meetings drag on and on forever. He also forgets things sometimes, which is kind of sad, but to be honest I used this to my advantage a couple of times to low key gaslight him and hide my mistakes until I correct them. The hardest part, though, is that hes sometimes resistant to new ideas. I wouldn't say he is overly conservative, but he often tends to push back on creative suggestions, which leaves our website and social media feeling pretty uninspiring.

So, why am I still here? :) The job is easy, pays very well (I can save a lot), and my manager, while professionally lacking a lot of kills, excels on a personal level. Hes thoughtful with Christmas and birthday gifts, genuinely celebrates our achievements, and creates a kind, inclusive environment, checks on people when they're sick, recommends doctors, etc.

"2084","2024-11-29",1732897366,"Should I Transition From an AI Startup to a GenAI Consulting Role?","Im in a bit of a career crossroads right now and would love to get your thoughts and advice. Heres the situation:

For nearly three years, I worked in the marketing and business development department at a Big 4 company. I loved it in the beginningworking on various projects, initiatives, and partnerships was exciting. But over time, the work became repetitive. Year after year, I found myself handling the same tasks, and I started to feel stagnant. To make matters worse, my boss was far from inspiring. She wasnt strategic at all and often pushed operational, mundane tasks onto me that she simply didnt want to handle. I reached a point where I was completely fed up.

About a month ago, I decided to take a leap and join a fast-growing AI startup as a Customer Success Manager (CSM). Ive always been deeply interested in tech, startups, and innovation, so it felt like a natural move. But the reality of the role has been far from what I expected.

The team has been incredibly controlling, the culture feels toxic, and many of my interactions with colleagues have been outright rude. Instead of focusing on customer success strategies, it feels like Ive been doing glorified customer support. This wasnt the dynamic or environment I was hoping for, and its left me feeling lost and questioning my decision.

Out of the blue, a leader from the GenAI department from my previous Big 4 company, someone I know well and have a great relationship with, reached out to see how I was doing. During our conversation, I opened up about how much I love the intersection of AI and client-facing work but shared that other aspects of my current rolelike the culturearent what I expected. I also admitted Ive been reflecting on whether this new company is the right long-term fit for me.

Thats when she surprised me with an offer: a potential senior consultant role in the AI department, specifically focusing on Microsoft Copilot implementations. She explained that the role would likely evolve as the department continues to partner with more companies and integrates new technologies. Its an exciting opportunity, especially since consulting has always piqued my interest. But its also a big shift.

Aside from my current CSM role, my career has been rooted in marketing. I love creative work, brand strategy, client experience, and anything involving innovation. Moving into a consulting role in GenAI feels like it could open a lot of doors, but Im worried it might also close some. Would transitioning to consulting shun me from the marketing world entirely? Or could this move actually expand my career perspectives and position me for more opportunities down the line?

Im at a point where I really want to make the right decisionnot just for now, but for my long-term growth. If anyone has made a similar transition, works in GenAI or consulting, or has insight into career paths that bridge these industries, Id love to hear your thoughts. What are the pros and cons I should be considering? Is this a smart move, or should I stick it out in my current role and see if things improve?

This is one of the thing, by doing which I've seen some people around me giving their credit cards freely to their children and roaming in the the luxury cars and buying new machines every festivals.

Along with having supply business they are buying machineries like trucks and excavator so as to exapand business and earn more. 

Sad thing is I can't directly ask them regarding it, they may not want anybody to take foot in their line of business that's how people are here.

I don't want to do job forever, I can't be with my peers, all they want to do is job in high companies with high pays, but working under someone is too much for me. I don't know to say yes for anyone's convenience and never said during my fresher year just now. only when some part of the job that was under my control, I've enjoyed but again salary sucked. Guys with 4 5 years experience and salary as double as mine were either running away from the difficult part or fcked up most the time and here it guess interesting, all they did was trying to look like they were working hard and sweet talk with boss, OH MY GOD, that's how they've been doing it for that many years and got themselves high pay checks. And that licking shit, I didn't do that.

I can do either business oriented learning on site, I don't care about exprience anymore that status quo for doing it for the company and not me, I don't want that. Only problem is finging parallel project sites around the city. Usually the normal building project takes 1 or 2 years but learning it in it's different phases and skipping repititive saves the time. So out of 1 year only 2 3 months of total project is non repetitive in most cases same goes for roads when bridges and other work like bridge is not involved. This was just an example of how I want to learn. 

I want some guidance from specialists if they are here and if they are in Mumbai, India. Please guide me. My soul is screaming. What I want to do is not myself only. I've  always dreamt to have some conteibution for future generation too. Just doing a won't do it or rather it'll take couple of decades to reach there.

Read their harassment policy. Understand what the companys guideline is and make sure to point out how they are not following. Someone cant just accuse you and that is it. Sounds like the supervisor doesnt know how to process such a claim.
Go to HR, write an email stating what happens and send it to your personal email. Make sure you state you were sober and felt uncomfortable how the supervisor approached the situation. How they are not following their on policies or rules. 
If they have a hotline to report inappropriate behavior call it and say what happened. Document on your end when and what you said on the call. 
If you need to make a claim because they did not respond appropriately do it. Could be with the EEOC or check how your local labor law protects you. If the worse happens: Let them fire you if they are so dumb to do so. You will probably win unemployment and continue the claim and if you can talk to a lawyer (you can do this step anytime).

I think tossing out slander/ harassment is better. Theres no proof for 1, theres proof for the other

If you can somehow make it a tangible thing and not just what someone else said - cause thats not going to be much proof

Unfortunately the proof for ""damage"" is proving that what was said harmed your reputation and then you were punished for that.

But if the job never punishes you, then theres not proof

"2306","2024-11-29",1732894184,"How to deal with a chaotic manager and should I switch my profession (DevOps to IT Security)?","Hello,

I am from Germany and not a native english speaker, so please excuse my grammatical mistakes.

I am in a weird situation right now. I was hired as a DevOps Engineer for a german company, to build Gitlab- and Azure-Pipelines, assisting on releases and creating monitoring solutions etc. . Most of my tasks should contain typical DevOps stuff.

I like the company and my colleagues alot.

My manager is a different story. He is a kind guy, but with a super chaotic working style. He is a workaholic, can't delegate tasks and working 12+ hours a day. It is fine for him, when you are working regular hours (8 hours a day). I started the position as DevOps Engineer 1 year ago. My manager is always giving me tasks, that have nothing to do with my position, which he has me hired for. I am coordinating releases, but that's like 30 minutes of work every 3 weeks. Other tasks include giving permissions to email accounts or forwarding logging issues to our Ops team.

The project I am currently working for, has tons of DevOps tasks, I want to do, like building Gitlab- and Azure-Pipelines, maintaining containers or developing our Springboot backend.

In the past 12 months I talked to my manager 4 times, to get these DevOps tasks. My company has hired external staff, who are currently doing extra work to finish the DevOps tasks. I gave my manager a 3 month plan to take on these tasks and to reduce costs for my company in the long run. He is always saying, that my plan is good and that he supports it. After 2 days he has forgetting my plan and is giving me some random tasks again, that I didn't apply for. After my 4. meeting I told him, that it is his last chance to commit with me to the tasks, I am specialized for and that should be my primary work in the first place. But he is still not taking me seriously. And the weird part is, that I can straight up ignore him right now and he is fine with it. My coworkers have a similar relationship with him and are frustrated too. 3 of them want to leave too.

I like DevOps a lot. My job is well paid for Germany. But I am so bored, angered and annoyed all the time because of my situation. I want to do more work, but he won't let me do it.

I have 2 options now:

**Option 1: Switch to IT Security**  
I could switch to a different position, but would have to give up DevOps. The other position would be a consulting role in IT security. Same payment, way better manager, but different working area. It has nothing to do with DevSecOps. I find IT security very interesting, but the position would only be about consulting, so I am doing no tech work.

**Option 2: Waiting for months, until a new DevOps unit is created**  
In Q4/2025 a new DevOps unit will be created, which I find interesting. But I would have to wait almost 12 months and I don't know, if I can hold out so long. Also I didn't know, which manager I will get in the end. Perhaps I could various trainings and certifications in this time, but for 10+ months??

I honestly don't know what to do. I talked to several colleagues about it, but they couldn't give me an advice.","careerguidance",0,"https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1h2o96n/how_to_deal_with_a_chaotic_manager_and_should_i/",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

If you know of any suitable roles or have advice, Id appreciate your help. Thanks in advance!","careerguidance",0,"https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1h2o8vw/any_englishspeaking_finance_or_audit_job/",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

- I am his deputy and he has once even extended his holiday without letting me know. If I hadn't double checked his out of office when he didnt show (he changed the dates) there would have been meetings attended by nobody. 
- He has also previously approved  a team members time off without letting me know, leaving us incredibly short-staffed.
- He fails to communicate about vital stuff often and does not include me in decisions. I have asked him if there is an issue with my performance or any reasons he wouldnt want to and he says no and Im great. But due to the  lack of communication Ive been unable to answer questions and give updates in his absence.

- He often gives me the silent treatment and is blunt with me when I have worked on a successful project which gives me visibility with senior leadership. (Has taken me so long to due this as he has suppressed everything I do or taken credit for it.)
- When I have previously asked him for guidance on who the best member of staff to reach out to about a request he responded with rude sarcasm.

I've been a self-employed jeweler for the past 10 years, a freelance translator for a few years before that and I have a BA in English Philology. Currently I have my small jewelry biz operated just by me, but with each year it's becoming more and more difficult to earn money with it, and it's taking a toll on my mental health.

So I'm trying to decide what's next. I don't want to be a bench jeweler and do repairs; I'm not interested in teaching, especially at school; translators get very little money here; and after 10 years of promoting my work I want to forget about sales and marketing forever.

For many years I had this idea that I could become a programmer. In my early 20s I regretted not studying CS. I'm good with logics and I used to be good at calculus in school (we had a specialized maths class). I don't have any real programming skills, but I've started learning independently. I'm also considering distance learning at a local university and getting into a bootcamp at some point. But I'm wondering if this is an adequate decision. I realize that it might take me a couple of years to get some entry level job, and I'm OK with that, but also afraid that I might *never* get a job in this field due to my age and quite random work experience.

The local guides have been great and your English would be a big plus since every tour I've taken has been 100% American tourists.  You do have to be a ""people person"" willing to deal with the occasional high-maintenance person.  On one tour a woman called the guide to find her when she got lost in Antigua, Guatemala.  You'd be an independent contractor but most of them seem to get customers from other sources as well.  You'd also need to be a problem-solver but they have a very strong head office.

I like both since they both offer a patient free environment while still being in the medical/dental field. I would say that a dental tech has more appeal to me since I am interested in detailed and physical work that I can use my hands. It's like arts and crafts in a way! Sterilization tech on the other hand, I don't mind. It has the quality of being hands on and assemble trays. Getting to learn about all the different medical instruments being used is also quite interesting. 

In my city, the dental technician course is 4 terms in length while the sterilization tech is only 2 terms. Another reason why I'm interested in being a sterilization tech is because the course only has one prerequisiteEnglish! while the dental technician course requires English, Math and Science. I am currently upgrading and taking these courses so if ever, I would have the prerequisite to take either! In terms of salary, in my city, the dental tech is paid more than the sterilization tech.

The majority of high paying, decent work life balances, stable job description with occasionally interesting days, that's relatively straightforward for biology majors to get is something in healthcare/allied healthcare. Anything else has more risk to it, and more care and attention is needed with plotting the right career path. 

Biotechnology in my opinion is a bit dependent on the individual person, it can be quite easy or hard. I think you have to research this pathway very thoroughly/look for previous people who were successful here or had the  career you want, and try to get a feel for if it suits you. 

I heard psychology is a decent career but can be highly competitive to get into. 

I don't know much about neuroscience but I'm guessing it's more like biotechnology and you have to research it in particular/find previous people who had careers you liked there and see if you think you can replicate it. 

I think biology and psychology don't have much math, but I'm not sure about biotechnology or neuroscience. 

If I were you I'd try to go for something in healthcare where the subfield of biology relevant to it is interesting so you'll always have a stable career, and read up on your interests in either of those subjects in your spare time. I know lots of people who had a stable job and spent 1-4 hours a week (not much over a week) reading up a field of their interest, who did it for decades, and they were content with this pattern. And maybe they would find more opportunities in their field of interest later on, but with a stable career they could fallback on later. I think it could give the same amount of satisfaction as pursuing a more risky career in a niche field.

Psychology opens up paths in clinical work, counseling, or even areas like organizational development. Neuroscience could take you into research, healthcare, or cutting-edge fields like brain-computer interfaces, though it might involve some quantitative work depending on your focus. Biotech is biology-heavy but can require more math, so it might be worth looking into specific programs to see how much math youd actually need. If youre passionate about biotech, dont let math scare you off entirelymany roles are more lab-focused and less about complex equations.

Since youre weighing options and want something exciting and fulfilling, you might find the GradSimple newsletter helpful.

Hi everyone!

Typing this at work so bear with me if there are mistakes.

I have been an HR intern at a global firm in my country for almost 4 months now. I got the internship as part of my university studies, as it requires me to have one semester of internship prior to writing my thesis.

Originally, I was given many tasks by my manager ( the only other HR person in a 130 employee firm, btw) but now she just stopped giving me significant tasks. I am scared to approach her as she seems quite busy and is always in meetings (to which I am never invited to, despite being HR-related). 

I just want more recognition and guidance but feel like she is just waiting for my internship to be over to get rid of me, despite of being needed as the only other HR person in the firm. 

Maybe I am wrong and need to do something differently but I really want to develop myself in the field and grow to become a good HR professional with experience and expertise. I cant do that if I am not trusted, ignored or neglected all the time.

Should I approach the problem and if so,how? 

Should I just let my internship pass and leave to look for something better ( with only 6 months of work experience) despite delaying my graduation?

Any advice would be appreciated greatly as I feel like crying right now.","careerguidance",4,"https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1h2kjm9/how_to_stop_feeling_like_i_do_not_matter_at_work/","WannabeSociaI","2024-11-29",1732883163,2,2,0,0,"I think you don't have to worry if you're a confident learner and you want to succeed.

A few days before assuming this team, another Technical Manager (TM) was hired, and I didnt get the promotion. Its unclear whether the new TM blocked it or if hiring quotas were not met. My direct Team Leader, who has been a huge supporter of mine, believed the new TM didnt want to risk putting such a new analyst into a supervisory position that could potentially harm overall results or his reputation. Another Team Leader argued that the hiring quotas werent met. I dont have enough information to conclude which is true.

Last month, the TM went on overdue vacation, and a Team Leader was chosen to cover his role. I was selected to cover that Team Leaders position and assume responsibility for his team for a month. During this time, I maintained positive results and improved negative KPIs. When the TM returned, I heard that other TLs had praised my performance, and analysts also complimented my work.

This week, another Team Leader needed to leave his post for specific training, and I was chosen to cover his position. Next month, my own Team Leader will go on vacation, and the TM has already asked me directly to cover his role.

Now, heres the main issue: a new cell is being created. It offers higher pay than my current position but significantly less than a TL role (about a thousand bucks less). I was offered a position in this new cell and accepted it. While my colleagues were set to start immediately, I was scheduled for the December team because of my Team Leader activities.

Today, while asking me to cover my TL that will go on vacation (meaning that I would supervise the new cell for a moth), the TM informed me that he will need to make rearrangements across all teams and that a new TL position will be created. However, I cant assume this position because Ive recently been promoted, and company policy prevents me from being promoted again within three months.

The TM expressed concern that this situation might demotivate me. I assured him that it wouldnt and that I would continue working hard until I was offered a position. He mentioned possibly speaking to higher-ups to arrange a bonus for me due to my performance (hes aware of my personal situation). This conversation occurred in the presence of my Team Leader. The TM also mentioned the possibility of a TL position in another shift and asked if I would consider it. I told him I preferred the night shift because of the higher pay but would consider another shift if it made sense and my (pregnant) wife agreed.

However, I recently realized that a TL position in a different shift would pay slightly more than being an analyst in the new cell during the night shift.

Now, Im struggling to assess the situation. I cant tell if my TM is just bad luck or if hes deliberately holding me back. I also cant decide whether accepting a TL role in another shift is the best move or if I should wait for an opportunity in the night shift. Finally, Im unsure how I should approach this situation moving forward.

I tend to be suspicious of people, but I havent concluded that my TM is acting maliciously. He seemed sincere about everything.

**TL;DR:**  
Im being held back, either due to bad luck or a malicious manager, and I dont know whether to wait for a TL position in the night shift or accept a position in the day shift, even if it pays less.

Most companies include some kind of clause that lets them part ways if things arent working out. But that doesnt mean its a done deal in your case. Youre still there, and until you hear something directly from them, its not over.

The fact that theyre revisiting your emails and posted a new opening could mean a lot of things. It might not even be about you. Maybe theyre expanding the team or just planning ahead. But if youre feeling behind, its not a bad idea to check in with your manager and ask for feedback. It shows youre proactive and willing to put in the effort. It could even shift how they view you.

While youre still there, keep showing up and giving it your best. If they do decide to let you go, its not the end of the world. Internships are about learning, and sometimes things just dont click. For the next opportunity, consider something that aligns more with your pace or learning style. Ive been in situations where things didnt pan out, and honestly, thats how I found Jobsolv. It had a mix of higher-quality roles, including hybrid ones, that didnt feel overwhelming. Its worth checking out if you want something solid to fall back on.

And hey, dont psych yourself out. Youve already made it through their selection process, which means youve got potential. Take this as a learning curve, not a dead end. Stay focused, keep communicating, and see where it goes.","6"

I started working for my current company two months ago in a lower-tier position. Before this, I had about a year and a half of experience in similar, slightly more challenging roles in the same industry, where I developed a solid skill set and knowledge base to help me grow professionally.

Recently, my company offered to switch my contract from an office-based role to a location-based one. However, the new role felt like a step down in both challenge and responsibility, so I turned it down.

When I explained my reasons - namely, wanting to focus on positions that align with my skills and offer room for growth -  was told Id never be considered for roles in that area of the company again. Additionally, they said I needed to pay my dues at the company, essentially by taking positions below my skill level before being considered for anything better.

This felt like a slap in the face. My prior experience elsewhere seems to have been completely dismissed, and I now feel like my chances of progressing within this company are slim.

Where do I go from here? Has anyone else been in a similar situation, and how did you handle it?

TLDR: My company offered me a role thatI felt was a step down, so I turned it down. When I explained I wanted a more challenging position to grow my skills, I was told Id never be considered for that area again and needed to pay my dues by taking a lower-level role first.

Context : I am 20M and had a lot of academic failures in past 2-3 yrs . Was the worst phase and also my mistakes contributed, but now I am recovering , doing a distance degree and pursuing a course in management accounting. My inherent nature is very ambitious especially throughout my schooling years &amp; I achieved a lot of academic success for my efforts.

The problem which I faced while I was in regular college and which I know would be facing once I do a real job is being surrounded by lazy , slacking peers. You know , there was a time where I used to do all the efforts but since everyone in my group was like laid back and wanted to be bare minimum and cook up some shit at the end and submit even I was termed like that . Where my extra efforts in group work were literally not recognized because my partners were like that.

I respect them and I understand that not everyone is as amibitious as I am who gets excited at this stuff and just puts in alot of energy. But if I in person , am doing my bit more proactively and in general putting above average efforts in compared to my peers , I think it deserves should be recognized by my superiors. But I don't know how to do that.

In my schooling years in our education system it is just very individualistic , meaning you will be recognized for your work , projects , assignments and exams , group work was almost negligible.  However in real life , you hv to collaborate and I am obviously  looking forward to it. 

Like the best idea that I get is to maintain a record and submit it alongside.  Is there anything else I could do ?

I am looking to transfer to a university (out of state) by the Fall 2025 semester. I've been very hesitant while filling out my applications for the schools I'm interested in because I'm not exactly sure which major aligns best with my passions (and desires in life LOL) and I don't want to apply for the wrong major. I've done some research on each individual school I'm interested in and their public relations &amp; advertising, comms, and journalism majors. So far, I'm very interested in Chapman University's Public Relations &amp; Advertising program.   
  
Here are some of my interests:

- I love pop culture, the entertainment industry, movies &amp; TV, and social media
- I am pretty tech savvy. I'd say I know more than general knowledge.
- I don't consider myself to be an amazing writer but I hope to become a better writer throughout college (I'm taking a journalism course next semester). English technically wasn't my first language growing up. Up until I was 8-9 years old, I was in ELL (English Language Learner) programs at my school. I feel like this is why I'm usually lacking in my vocabulary and the reason why I am not confident with my writing skills.  
- I have a lot of experience with Adobe apps (I'm confident with Premiere but still learning AE, Photoshop, Illustrator in school. I'm taking a ""Level 2"" course on those apps next semester) I also have some experience with iMovie and Canva.  
- I have some experience with a small, non-profit media agency. I've edited boutique commercials (no dialogue, just music and aesthetics), sports reels, and vlogs. I no longer work with them as most of the work was hands-on and the commute there &amp; back became an issue for me.
- I guess do freelance work every now and then. I like making my own videos and editing things for anyone that asks me. I enjoy making content that makes my friends laugh.
- I consider myself to be a creative person. I've always been intrigued by art and the arts. I love anything where I can express myself creatively.
- I hate working with numbers and money. I'm terrible at math and I don't have any interest in finance related careers. Just nothing with big numbers
- In the future, I'd be happy being some kind of video editor, or someone that comes up with (creative) marketing ideas, or creating digital art/graphic design for companies. For example, I love everything about SNL. I love the pre-recorded videos they make and all of their marketing shit. I guess that'd be my dream job!

What do I do?","TL;DR - 29M, +6 months unemployed, struggling to find a stable role where I can grow and be respected. Solid experience in operations, marketing, and IT/engineering (including roles at FAANG companies), stuck in a cycle of short-term jobs ending due to layoffs/mismanagement.

\---

Hello there!

Long time lurker, first time poster. I'm 29M, graduated from university with a bachelors degree in theatre from a well-regarded university in the USA. While my degree isn't the most traditional for a corporate career, I've built solid experience across operations, marketing, and IT/engineering at a few great businesses including two FAANG companies, two starts ups, and a mid-sized creative advertising firm. I was even overemployed for six months last year, working multiple remote full-time jobs (FAANG + start up) as a hedge against my harsh reality of being laid off every 6-12 months for the past five years due to factors ranging from company mismanagement and budget cuts to mass layoffs and business downsizing - never anything performance-related. While I've been laid off more times than I can count, I have always managed to land on my feet a few months later - shaken and a bit more broke, but not quite broken.

This time, however, things feel different. I've been out of work since May (+6 months and counting) with no clear end to the drought in sight. There was a time when I had professional aspirations, but that kind of thinking faded a few layoffs ago - its hard to stay motivated when opportunities vanish as quickly as they appear. While Im confident in my ability to deliver outstanding results across businesses, roles, and industries, Ive completely lost faith that any company will treat me with decency or provide stability.

Ive sent out thousands of resumes and have hit everyone in my contact network's contact network trying to find a company where I can grow and develop for longer than a year. 

I've heard every imaginable piece of feedback about my CV - highlights include:

* I ""don't have a typical background"" (usually a polite way to ask ""why tf are you interviewing here"")
* I have ""too much experience"" to apply to entry-level or junior roles at this stage in my career
* I ""don't have enough tenure at one company"" or ""enough subject matter expertise"" to qualify for senior roles

I've gone through the entire interview process at multiple companies - only to be ghosted or told after I've done their 5-7 interviews and hours-long case studies that the company would be going in a different direction with hiring for the role. All of the companies I have interviewed with been kind enough to provide feedback when I have asked, and have confirmed through their positive feedback that I do good work and interview well - just not well enough to offer me the job.

I'm at a loss. I want a role where I can grow, stay long enough to be eligible for a promotion, and work with people who respect my contributions. My professional aspirations have shifted from skills (e.g. I want to grow as a software engineer) to more basic emotional needs: stability, mentorship, respect.

I am very fortunate in a lot of ways: I have a loving family, a supportive fiancee, good friends, and my health. However, Im not made of money - and this cycle of constant instability is draining me mentally and financially. It's hard to plan for the future when my career feels like I'm stuck on a hamster wheel.

Any advice would be appreciated - how to find a job with real long-term potential, or even just cope with the day to day frustration? Would appreciate any insights - or at least some good memes to cheer me up.","careerguidance",1,"https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1h2gmut/29m_6_months_unemployed_lost_faith_in_finding_a/",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

She had been with the company for a little longer, and had a master's degree which let her climb faster. She left as a level III making 72k. Not long ago, I also took over the entire AOR of one of the company's most senior employees. He had been at the company for more than 50(!) years, and was a level IV. I worked alongside him learning his job pretty much since I started. His roles had been exclusively done by him, without a backup, since the 1980s. It's not a hard role, but it has a ton of visibility and requires a lot of care and attention. Lately, I have been putting in 10 and 11 hour days to stay on top of everything. I don't have a backup. If I take a day or two off, I just have more to get through when I return. They're trying to get me more help in the coming months.

I like the work and am very good at it, but the volume of work is just unsustainable, and letting quality slip is just not an option. I like my boss and the people, and I have a flexible schedule. I only have a BA degree, so it's good I have a salaried job with benefits, but I know this situation is not fair or sustainable. My bosses like me but there is a bit of a brick wall in raises, to the point where we don't bring it up because it just doesn't happen. Over the last few years I have gotten adjustments and raises of a couple percent here and there. My boss says he is all for me going up to level III for a 6% raise, but at that point they will eliminate my overtime pay and I will effectively get paid the same. I cannot do this job by myself by working just 8 hours a day. Unpaid overtime is somewhat expected at level III, but not exactly required. 

I really don't know what to do. I know I am getting screwed, but don't know if I can find anything better. I have a BA and no certs, and have a great resume from the work I have done at my job.

"2423","2024-11-30",1732984492,"How hard is it to pay off $100k in student loans? What should I pursue?","
Hi Reddit!

Im a graduating high school student and Im very conflicted with what program I should pursue. The two options are engineering vs. aviation, but Im not sure how feasible the second option really is. For some context, Im a student from Canada and I come from a middle class family. Both programs are at the University of Waterloo.

Program option 1: Systems Design Engineering
This program will cost about $90k for 5 years of tuition, excluding living expenses such as housing and meal plans. However, it includes up to 2 years of coop experience which would earn me about $96k assuming Im working at an average salary of $25/h. This would be able to cover almost all of my expenses over the 5 years.

Program option 2: Geography and Aviation
This program costs a total of about $130k in tuition over 4 years, including flight training fees but not including living expenses. I would graduate with both a bachelors of environment and a commercial plane license. However, it does not have a coop option, so I would not be making any income other than a possible part time job. My parents are willing to help pay a portion of the tuition, but I would still be stuck with over $100k in student loans. Im also a bit scared because I know the entry level job opportunities generally have a low salary, especially in comparison to engineering.

The answer seems really obvious when looking at the numbers but Im really conflicted because I dont know if engineering is the right field for me. Ive been interested in building robots and different systems since grade 9 but I think my passions fall more under the skilled trades than it does engineering. I dont think I have enough drive to actually land a good internship or strive in the field. Furthermore, I have not come across any engineering job descriptions that Im actually interested in working. All of my peers who are pursuing engineering are either really passionate about it or really want the money, and I do not fall into either of those categories. My goal is not money, I just want to make enough to live a comfortable middle class lifestyle. 

I think I would enjoy piloting a lot more than a 9-5 engineering job, but I cant be completely sure as Ive never actually gotten to experience either. I first became interested in the idea of piloting in grade 10, but put it off because it was deemed unrealistic. Then I started considering it again this year after attending a university fair. I know that piloting is a difficult/unconventional job compared to the typical 9-5. I have done research on the lifestyle of a pilot and what the job usually consists of. The work schedule is not an issue to me. Am I just being immature for considering piloting on such a whim?

What do you guys think? Is repaying $130k of student debt as a pilot in Canada realistic? Am I going to dig myself into a hole? 

EDIT: if it was a different engineering program, say UofT, without mandatory coop, leaving me with $70k in debt, would your answers still be the same?

I've worked low wage ""low skill"" jobs my entire working life, so I do have a very robust set of soft skills from those jobs. These jobs have wrecked my body and I don't want and can't do physical jobs anymore. Due to life circumstances/university being prohibitably expensive/recently diagnosed adhd/poverty cycle, I never did or could do anything else. I moved to Germany 3 years ago and married my German partner recently, so now I have access to good education and job training subsidies.

I took a month long full time intro to different IT professions and really enjoyed the web development and ux/ui portions. I really like being creative and making things with the combo of more technical aspects. I'm fully aware that I know nothing about it yet and the market is ridiculous right now especially for IT jobs, but I have considered so many different professions and this is the only job that has sparked interest for me and I want to scope it out before I go further down the path to doing it if its going to end up being completely useless.

If this field isn't viable, is there other similar jobs that have better prospects?

Edit: i have no interest in doing trades or health care. I would kill for an office job, and I have to do a creative job or else i would hate it. I would hate things like cybersecurity.

I started as a support engineer, transition to cloud DevOps support then a big data engineer, we use the Hadoop suite then will transition to GCP, I've been holding that role for 3 years.

I'm Salesforce certified, along with AWS data engineer and studied the basics of power bi and python.

Furthermore, I tinkered a bit with shell scripting and have decent knowledge and really fell in love with ServiceNow and studied, and I have the CSA and CAD certificates.

I really enjoy ServiceNow as a technology and being able to access a well documented product and spin a PDI and access everything, along with the ServiceNow JavaScript which with a few lines of code you can do really important work, and overall the job seems to hit the sweet spot between work/life balance and technicality

My concern now is Am I doomed as I have some project experience in data engineering as a support engineer that there is a touch chance to get into the ecosystem

My other concern, Is ServiceNow a sustainable rewarding career in the long run ?, for some reason I can't get myself to love Power BI or tableau, while I'm trying to master power bi, but it is a slow demotivating journey for me.

I'm 18 years old and I'm currently in my first year of university studying architecture, Ive wanted to pursue architecture since I was about 12 years old and I studied construction in college, enjoyed it and got an A* AA grade. 

Since I started university everyone around me keeps complaining about how architects only get paid £30-40,000 on average in the UK which they think is low considering the 7 years of studies we have to do to achieve our qualification. 

I personally don't think it's that much of an issue as there's the potential to earn more if you're more successful (not guaranteed of course). However it's started to give me some doubts about whether architecture really is worth the effort and stress that I would have to go through for a pretty average salary. 

I am passionate about architecture and I enjoy designing I just have concerns that I might try my hardest and fall flat on my face once it comes to being a fully qualified architect in the real world.

Outside of university I'm absolutely obsessed with cars (especially classic cars) and it pretty much consumes all of my thoughts and interests 24/7. So there's a part of me that wonders if I should consider doing something related to classic cars like a specialist dealership or maybe even restoration. 

However, with the current position in the UK with Ulez and the government banning petrol cars I'm concerned that the car market might collapse soon and I'm not sure if it's worth the risk. Or whether I should just stick with what I'm doing now and keep pushing.

"2454","2024-11-30",1732957582,"5 Simple Habits to Boost Your Productivity as a Student?","Being a student comes with its fair share of challenges: demanding schedules, assignments, and the pressure to perform. However, with the right habits, you can streamline your efforts, reduce stress, and achieve more. Lets explore five simple habits that can significantly boost your productivity as a student.

# 1. Set Clear Goals

One of the foundations of productivity is setting clear, actionable goals. When you know what youre working toward, it becomes easier to focus your efforts.

* **Why Goal Setting Works:** Goals provide direction and motivation. They help you prioritize and make the best use of your time.
* **SMART Goals for Students:** Make your goals Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. For instance, ""Study for 2 hours daily to improve my math grade by 10% this semester"" is a SMART goal.
* **Daily, Weekly, and Semester Goals:** Break larger objectives into smaller tasks. Start with semester goals, then plan weekly and daily tasks that align with these larger aims.

# 2. Prioritize Tasks

Not all tasks are equally important. Learning to prioritize ensures you spend time on what matters most.

* **The Eisenhower Matrix:** This tool categorizes tasks into urgent, non-urgent, important, and non-important quadrants, helping you identify where to focus
* **Techniques for Prioritizing:** Use to-do lists and rank tasks based on deadlines and impact. Apps like Todoist and Notion can help you stay organized.
* **The Power of Saying ""No"":** Avoid overcommitting to unnecessary activities that take time away from your priorities.

# 3. Use Time Management Tools

Managing your time effectively can help you accomplish more without feeling overwhelmed.

* **Benefits of Planners and Apps:** Planners provide structure, while digital tools like Google Calendar or Trello keep you on track. I personally use Google Calender.
* **Time-Blocking Schedule:** Allocate specific blocks of time for each task. For instance, dedicate 9-10 AM to reviewing lecture notes.
* **Top Tools for Students:** Explore apps like Undercoverdevs, Forest, or Evernote to streamline your schedule and track deadlines.

# 4. Maintain a Healthy Lifestyle

Your physical and mental health directly impacts your productivity.

* **How Sleep Improves Focus:** Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep to improve concentration and memory.
* **Exercise and Mental Clarity:** Regular exercise boosts endorphins, reduces stress, and sharpens focus. Even a 20-minute walk can make a difference.
* **Breath Exercise:** Use the Box Breathing Exercise for Mental Clarity. This breathing technique is used by Navy SEALs to stay calm and focused.
* **Healthy Eating for Sustained Energy:** Opt for brain-friendly foods like nuts, fruits, and whole grains to maintain energy throughout the day.

# 5. Limit Distractions

Distractions can derail your progress, but managing them effectively can help you stay focused.

* **Identifying Common Distractions:** From social media to noisy environments, recognizing your distractions is the first step to overcoming them.
* **Creating a Study-Friendly Environment:** Choose a quiet, organized space for studying. Use noise-canceling headphones if needed.
* **Digital Detox Strategies:** Set specific times for checking your phone. Apps like Focus Mode or Freedom can block distracting websites during study sessions.

# How to Build Consistency

* Start small and gradually increase the intensity of your habits.
* Track your progress with journals or apps.
* Reward yourself for milestones to stay motivated.

# Overcoming Procrastination

Breaking tasks into smaller chunks and tackling the easiest part first can reduce procrastination. Stay motivated by **visualizing** the end result and reminding yourself of your goals.

# Balancing Productivity and Rest

Rest is vital for sustaining productivity. Recognize the signs of burnout and allow yourself time to recharge through hobbies, naps, or meditation.

# FAQs: Boosting Productivity as a Student

**1. What are the most effective productivity habits?**  
Setting goals, managing time, and limiting distractions are among the most impactful.

**2. How can I stay consistent?**  
Track your progress and celebrate small wins to maintain momentum.

Prioritize rest and relaxation alongside your studies.

**4. What tools can I use to manage time?**  
Apps like Google Calendar, Trello, and Forest are excellent for students.

**5. How much sleep should students get for optimal productivity?**  
7-9 hours of sleep is ideal for peak mental performance.

**6. Can relaxation improve academic success?**  
Yes, taking breaks helps you absorb information better and reduces stress.

I went to a votech in high school so I already had completed a few hundred hours, so I'll be graduating pretty soon in January. I always thought I would enjoy cosmetology because I always enjoyed doing my hair, nails, skincare, etc (although I mostly focus on hair).Thing is, I absolutely hate it. The social aspect is killing me because I'm introverted as hell, and people love to talk when they go to a salon (I also have diagnosed social anxiety which makes it very hard to overcome being a quiet introvert). And the actual work itself is so stressful because even if you do an overall good job, if you mess up in one or two spots, clients are still going to be unsatisfied. And yes, I've done a little of everything, hair, nails, waxing, facials, lashes, everything cosmetology offers. I feel the same about all of it. I just absolutely hate making the 50 minute drive to school every day and dealing with everything, there is not a single day I am excited for. Every time a client gets booked with me I get so nervous and anxious. I feel like I should just graduate since I've put money into it already, but I do not want to work at a salon afterwards. I would seriously rather work as a fast food employee or waitress. I hate how not even a year after graduating I feel like I've messed up my life for the next few years because of the money I've wasted.

So, what do I do?? Should I use my license when I graduate even though I hate it? Would it be better to just work some unskilled labor job while going to school for something else? I definitely don't want to do traditional college, but I am open to trade schools or anything that requires training without a degree, &amp; maybe would consider community college if it's gonna improve my career.

"2456","2024-11-30",1732955799,"28 years old, no savings. Just got laid off. Can I still get a good job to own property in a few years? ","Hi everyone,

I am a 28F. I am extremely addicted to shopping and therefore have no savings even though I have been working for 2 years of a 60k year salary job. Obviously I had a wakeup call after I got laid off.

I feel like such a loser and so behind! Any tips on how I can invest/own property in a few years? I live in Ontario, Canada btw. I also have a goal to save 100k by 3 years but also living a decent life. 

I'm also worried about getting a new job. I went to a top university here in Ontario (UofT) but never ended up finishing. Jobs didn't seem to care about that for some reason since all they saw was I attended. I will one day go back and finish. I don't have any rent to pay as my husbands parents have an almost paid off house and they are only here for the summer in Ontario. So the only catch is we live with them for 3 months. My bills that are a MUST come up to about $500 a month with cats/helping out the needy (as this is a passion of mine.) 

Any stories you guys have about yourself? I suddenly feel so sad and defeated. I really want to be successful and I wasted my life on materialistic things. I have zero debt maybe just my school loan that's like 15k left as my parents paid off 100k already. I can't be a burden on them anymore either as they are old. Everyone around me seems to be so successful and then there's me...

Edit: guys I am not asking to save 100k in 3 years with my 60k salary but if I upgrade to a job that would make me 80k a year. I really want to level up. I could upgrade in tech sales as an account manager or customer success. Also I got laid off so have zero salary right now :) ","careerguidance",43,"https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1h38c67/28_years_old_no_savings_just_got_laid_off_can_i/",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"2459","2024-11-30",1732952035,"Currently in School, Wanting to Take a Gap Year After Graduation to Advance Future Career?","Hi! So a little about me,,, 

Im currently a second year music major at a community college. I play decently on the viola (my main instrument) and currently take lessons to learn piano. My community college only offers music, but I want to study music business to continue my musical education. I also want to pick up the knowledge (business) that may or may not outweigh the benefits of solely focusing on music. I am paying for my classes out of pocket (I sighed) and Ive been having troubles with FAFSA. My goal is to become a festival organizer/director or manager in the music industry.

Reasons Why I Have Considered A Gap Year:

1) To improve my viola performance, as well as the piano (and thinking about picking up the trumpet and a woodwind halfway through the gap year)

2) To balance out my finances (I currently work in retail, its okay but its not something I want career-advancing)

3) Wanting to get myself out there and try something new (Viola gig, Music production, Voice acting, ASMR channel >, and maybe an events/festival-esque internship or getting another job that benefits me in that area)

4) My states college doesnt offer a specific music business degree. It only offers a music bachelors with business ELECTIVES. I was thinking about doing a full-time semester there, before transferring out of state. And honestly, at this point, double majoring with something else doesnt sound too bad,,,, Im thinking about doing 1-3 business-related classes at my CC, to keep the academic mind busy.

5) Wondering if my path would be similar or better off as a marketing major. (This line of thinking is most likely due to the music major stigma that surrounds me)

5) FAFSA is scaring me (Ive considered a lot of options, including the possibility of scholarships, and Ill probably end up with some kind of debt anyway)

So my main thing now is, should I push myself to do that gap year or should I jump straight into it? What are your ideas on making my gap year as effective as I can? Or if youre against the gap year, how would you suggest I open myself up to these new opportunities? While some of these new ideas/hobbies are for my entertainment, could you see some skills being transferred to a future music business major? What did you think about the marketing idea, should I pursue it? 

Sorry for all these little questions, but any input is appreciated!","careerguidance",1,"https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1h37gom/currently_in_school_wanting_to_take_a_gap_year/",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I have always been passionate art, specifically digital art and animation - I really enjoy activities where I design, customize, or draw something. Of course, I don't want to be an artist full time, so I've been searching for a career that has elements of design or creativity in it. 

A couple years ago, I dived into coding and was set on computer science/software engineering. I've been doing some game dev projects, and I currently work as a coding tutor (I teach Python mostly). But I don't feel super passionate about it and I haven't done projects - many of my peers who are into coding are doing much more than me and I don't feel like this is the right path for me. Plus I've done research on the software engineer life and it seems a bit bleak + endless grinding + the field is super saturated and it's hard to get jobs rn. 

So now I'm unsure what career to do. I feel like the tech field is over saturated and I wont be able to get a job / stand out. I'm wondering if there's a career that has tech &amp; engineering or tech &amp; business which will always be in demand (and pays well).

- neuroscience / neurosurgery (I do however feel repelled by this pathway as it affects the quality of life to a significant extent - while you earn a lot, you need to put in a ~ equal extent of effort into the work as well.)

I am 37 F. I had steady job in content marketing till 2020. Around the time covid lockdowns happened, I also got diagnosed with endometriosis. It was excruciating and I really couldn't even sit properly for more than an hour. 

Till 2023, I had a part time on-again off-again arrangement going on with a basic entry level content writing job. During this time, I also got married, fought two flare-ups of auto-immune diseases that ruined my skin, got on heavy steroids as medications and ruined my metabolism and physical health further, and suffered a mental breakdown while dealing with the grief of losing my mother. 

Just when I was getting a little better physically and mentally, my employer announced layoffs and I was on the list. 

To be fair, with everything that was going on in my life, I wasn't really contributing much. So, the layoff doesn't hurt me much - even I would have fired myself at some point. 

Now, it's been more than a year and I am recovering well. However, I feel completely lost. I don't have a degree in marketing. And now that I am practically starting from scratch, I don't know which direction to go in? 

Should I invest in a marketing degree? 

Should I opt for a completely different career trajectory? If so, what are my options? The only two things that I am good at (apart from my experience in marketing) are data analysis and being empathetic. I know it sounds really weird, but people who are struggling in their lives are somehow always drawn to me, and I tend to listen and give great advice. And they always come back to thank me. Some of those people as well as my friends and family have suggested that I should build my career in counselling. 

Of course, I am no professional. Being a professional would mean that I would need to get a master's at the very least, and a few recognizable certifications. I would also need to work as an intern and an assistant before I can even think of starting my own practice. I am not sure how much time all of this would take, and if I should even consider it as an option. Family and friends can be kind, and trying to be hopeful on my behalf, but I want a practical perspective. 

Similarly, for data analyst role, I know the basics of SQL and R, but I have always had people with Master's and PhDs in the field to help me with complex data. And considering the current market, data analysis seems like a tough place to break into. There are no high-paying jobs, and there's tonne of talent (with academic backing and experience) to compete with. Would I be able to make something out of the little knowledge that I have? I understand that I would need further education in this. But as I said, I am completely lost at this point and can't even pick an option to stick to out of the three distant possibilities that I have.

Recently I got an offer for a bigger cyber company with the same role as technical support engineer ( email security ). The role is diverge and has much to learn and develop, but there are two main issues;

it's not a remote job it's hybrid model with 3 days in the office, and it takes 2-3 hours for 1 route ( 5h for 2 way direction)

they pay the same money I'm receiving now - the fact that my current company pays high from the beginning ( regardless if you are experienced or not) I actually did a devops course so I can transition my self in my current company but I don't feel my self confident to take this path yet as it needs much effective time study and needs a decent experience with lot of understanding of different technologies ( where I can learn in the job without putting effort at home too much ). and I feel overwhelmed because of amount of material I have learned in the past two years with no real time implementation.

A bit long sorry.. but I feel lost here.

Thoughts? Thanks

"2481","2024-11-30",1732940161,"Should I straight up quit my job, stay, or give 2 weeks?","Context: I'm a 18M still in High School and about 4-5 months ago I got a job (my first one) at this trampoline park, and I've been working on and off. So far, I've had terrible experiences with the management such as:  
One of the managers adding me on Instagram and attempting to pick me up  
The scheduling manager not wanting to do her job properly and having an EXTREMELY rude altitude  
The general manager who is somewhat controlling and two faced (he acts friendly, but when you apparently do something wrong, he gets frustrated at you and tells you to do it the ""right way"")

Anyways, I was putting up with this until a couple days ago when I had two back-to-back experiences with my managers again. Before I say this, I'll admit I'm somewhat partially at fault for both these encounters. I was scheduled to work Tuesday (11:00 AM - 5:30 PM) and Saturday (11:30 - 4:30 PM) , which I mixed up the shifts for. So, I left my house at around 11:20 (work is a short drive), and my scheduling manager called me. I answered her call, and she immediately began asking where I was in this condescending tone. I told her I mixed up my shifts and right as I was about to apologize, she interrupted me and just said ""When are you going to be here?"", I just said 10 minutes then she said ""Hurry up, Bye"" then hung up. I think I'm being a little too sensitive, but I felt the way she handled it was poor. I showed up to my shift and she was just flat out rude to me all day. (this is not new behavior though; my coworkers also experience this from her).  
At around 3:30, I was sent to clean the restrooms, so I had to go to the kitchen (the park is indoor and has a cafe) to grab the cleaning supplies. I finished cleaning the restrooms, to put the supplies away and decided to check my phone for 5-10 seconds (I was checking the time and some messages quickly but in hindsight I probably shouldn't have considering we have a no cell phone policy), and as I was walking out the kitchen area I bumped into my general manager being followed by one of the assistant managers. To him it looked like I was texting (which I wasn't I was just checking messages and was literally about to put my phone away), and he immediately asked what I was doing and if I was on break. I answered honestly and he said ""You know our policies on phones, right?"" I apologized immediately, but then he just snatched the phone out of my hand before I could react. He handed it to the assistant manager next to him and told him to keep my phone until the end of my shift. I was just extremely stunned and didn't really know what to do. The general manager then pulled me aside into an empty party room, then began scolding me about the phone policy. He said that this was a severe violation, and I could lose my job over this and he could fire me over it. I honestly didn't know what to say and I impulsively said I was texting my mom for an emergency. He said that if it's an emergency they have to call the front desk not through my phone as phones aren't allowed at all. He then proceeded to tell the assistant manager to put this incident on my file and to make sure to keep my phone locked up.

They did hand me back my phone after my shift was over, but for the rest of the shift I was extremely angry and frustrated about what happened. I informed my parents about it and my mom told me I should just straight up quit. (she was really mad about the whole situation). I honestly don't even know what to do right now, I want to hand in a 2 week's notice as that's what I've been told to do as courtesy and I don't want to straight up quit as I'm afraid it'll bite me in the future. But then again, they did take my phone without my consent which I'm pretty sure is illegal, but I don't know.  
I just need help deciding whether to quit or not, and if I do should I just tell them I quit or hand in a 2 weeks?

Any advice would be appreciated, thank you.  
I'll try to clarify more things if anyone has any questions  
Also I don't know if this is important but I'm in this program at my school where I can earn credits for working at a job, which I need since I'm missing 5 of them. This job barely gives me any shifts and since September I only worked 52 hours and I need 90 hours in order to earn the right number of credits to graduate.

TL;DR: Terrible management, one of the managers snatched my phone and took it for the rest of the shift. Don't know whether to stay, quit, or give 2 weeks courtesy.","careerguidance",7,"https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1h34bb7/should_i_straight_up_quit_my_job_stay_or_give_2/",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I am struggling to figure out where to move forward with my job search. I currently have two jobs as a courier and a temporary job on the dock - they pay the bills and fit in my schedules, but won't work long term.

Here are my strengths and qualms.

* I suffered a major injury while studying electrical engineering. I lost a scholarship and had to move because I no longer qualified as in-state - I did not want to accrue debt.
* Spent 2-3 years trying various roles. Had roles as a tutor, doing framing, low level electrical helper work, courier, manufacturing - other than the courier job, all for less than a year. Changes in contract made it impossible to move forward.
* Went back to school for  a maths degree. Was encouraged to go into data analytics, but that field was a nonstarter by the time I was in the program. I planned to take some maths before transferring to an engineering program, but ended up meeting requirements a year before I expected.

I considered data analytics and considered looking there, but either due to changes in the market and budget cuts, both are nonstarters.

What should I do from here?  I've angled myself for logistics roles, and while some jobs have strict degree requirements, ones that don't have calls. I have no debt and have enough income as a courier to get by for now. I like construction and I like logistics, but there is only so much movement I can do because of ongoing injury treatment. I can only not disclose so much about my current medical state.

Where do I go? Do I go back to construction and get licensing in a trade? Do I whittle out my odds with the math degree? I have *some* experience, but without specific experience and licensing, it doesn't feel like I can go much anywhere.","careerguidance",0,"https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1h33t86/have_years_of_experience_in_multiple_disconnected/",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I graduated top of my class from a prep school (scholarship) and went to college (scholarship again) at a rigorous/prestigious liberal arts college, where I was supposed to do really well and become successful. I got to college and kind of went off my rocker a little bit tbf, majored in art and now have a BA in Studio Art. I was originally most interested in wildlife biology and writing. Never really had anyone to tell me that being an art major was maybe a bad idea or to guide me, so of course I couldnt find a job in art after I graduated and got extremely depressed for a very long time.

Now Im a manager at a grocery store, I do a great job, but I hate it so so much. I feel like I wasted my four years in college, and the ten years after college, when I could have been fixing my poor decisions.

A few years ago I tried to initiate a career change by doing a software bootcamp (I got a scholarship thank goodness), but I struck out trying to apply for jobs and internships and gave up after literally thousands of applications. Like in high school, I did a great job, learned a lot, and loved the challenge of learning something outside my comfort zone.

Now, Im 33 and I am feeling kind of desperate to redo the last fourteen years and redeem myself a little bit, as well as getting into a career that is actually fulfilling and that is fitting for my abilities.

Im not sure where to start, maybe I just need guidance. I started taking community college classes here and there, I took an anatomy and a biology class and loved it. I guess my problem has always been that I am genuinely interested in so many things and have a terrible time narrowing down my interests. Should I bother trying to get a different bachelors degree? My gpa was really bad when I graduated the first time, so I have concerns about being admitted into programs, and I also am not sure I can afford a second student loan for a redo.

I like really practical things and working with my hands, so I have thought about going into the trades or similar industries because it seems like there will be increased demand for those things in the future.

Closest thing I have is 4 months of research experience. My grades are good as well. For additional context Im studying overseas but will be returning to my home country (Singapore) after I graduate.

Most of the other jobs are in sustainability (corporate) which I have 0 clue about and don't have time right now to brush up on. I also cannot apply for internships because I'm graduating and most want continuing students.

I work for a company with quite a good name that seems to be growing pretty well. However, in my field they do not pay well. I've taken on a project coordinator role in the hopes of gaining skill in the project management space where I feel like my skills would be more transferable, meaning I can move out of the very niche marine field I decided to study. There are not many companies to work for in this field here. 

In order to make ends meet I have had to take on a second job. This job pays me in dollars (our exchange Rate is ZAR 18 =1$) and is editing scientific papers, it therefore still appeals to me. So far the best situation has been to have both jobs because two incomes, however after 3 years of doing this it is taking too much of a toll on my mental health. What is fun? I work 7 days a week. 

I've calculated that were I to quit job 1, I could make the same salary doing job 2 full time, however there is no growth there. The type of work better suits me as it's not so overwhelming as project coordination which is juggling 10000 tennis balls. And I can work from anywhere. I would also probably have enough spare time to try save up and do a project management course or something else. This job would maybe be a bit isolating though. 

Project coordination (job 1) for this company is quite overwhelming, I'm stressed all the time and don't make enough money, lots of travel but it's got potential for me to develop into a project manager in my field. It'd also be nice to not have wasted my time studying in the field. I have tried to negotiate my salary so I've covered that aspect, and currently there aren't any project management positions available. So it'll still be a while before I can grow to that.

I can't keep doing both jobs. I want to improve my mental health.

I am in a really tough spot and desperately need advice. I graduated with an engineering degree and after nine months of relentless job searching, I finally landed my first post-uni job as a Junior Civil Engineer. Most of my classmates secured jobs before graduation, making my job hunt even more difficult. Nevertheless, I persevered and was thrilled when I got an offer.

This job required me to move to a different state, leaving behind my entire life. I found a new apartment, furnished it, and started my new journey. My role was heavily centered around using AutoCAD, a software I had limited experience with. Over the months, I learned a lot about using the software and its commands. I eventually started receiving some design work after initial training, and things seemed to be going smoothly.

The company had a flexible policy and allowed some work-from-home (WFH) days. During my probation period, I worked from home for one day a week, and everything was fine. However, after eight months, my manager called me into their office. They told me that I was taking more time than others to complete drafts and designs, especially when working from home. They put me on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) and advised me to ask more questions and improve my performance, with a follow-up scheduled in three weeks.

Determined to prove myself, I worked every day at the office during those three weeks. I noticed that I was being assigned fewer design tasks and more drafting work, which was time-consuming and challenging. Other project managers became more distant, and my co-workers barely interacted with me. Despite this, I asked questions when needed and worked as fast as I could.

To my absolute shock and horror, at the end of those three weeks, I was called back into my manager's office and handed a termination letter. I was told to pack my things and go home immediately. I walked away in disbelief and devastation.

Now, I find myself jobless in a new area where I haven't had the chance to make friends or establish a support network. The only person I knew here was my manager. I'm alone, without money, and struggling to figure out how to get my civil engineering career back on track.

I am begging for any advice or support on how to recover from this setback and move forward. What should be my next steps? How can I regain my footing in this career that I worked so hard to start?

From 18-24, I was reliably employed and gained experience in retail, hospitality, janitorial, and call center positions. I held these jobs for 1-3 years each. Unfortunately, I followed this up with several short-term positions where I only worked for 1 week to 2 months, leading to significant gaps in my employment history. This job-hopping was mainly due to struggles with mental health (particularly anxiety and paranoia) and a lack of reliable transportation. I pretty much shocked myself with how I went from a totally independent hardworking person to not being able to hold a job at all. I'm disappointed to say the least. 

In terms of education, I earned an Associate of Arts degree in 2019. I attended university from fall 2019 until winter 2023, when I unenrolled to take a proper mental health break. I'm all set to return in summer 2025 and have only six courses left to fulfill my bachelors degree requirements. I'm majoring in sociology with a concentration in criminology, along with a minor in English. My GPA isnt great, but I plan to retake some classes to improve it, which will take additional time. 

I dont have any professional work experience yet, and Im concerned about how my job-hopping, employment gaps, and extended time in school might impact my future job prospects.

Will these things be a red flag for employers? What can I do now to improve my chances of getting hired and building a stable career? Any advice or guidance would be greatly appreciated!

I do not know if this is the right sub. I am literally looking for best practices out there while trying to keep my sanity. 

I have always been acting as a consultant in my past employment (private) hence its really just plug and play. Theres already a system in place and I just have to observe existing procedures when I do my job. Pretty easy once you get to know the rules.

But now this is different. In my current role (govt), I am basically a one-man team for this regional office. This is an entirely new industry and with no process flow or procedures in place, I feel overwhelmed. I dont know how soon Ill be given an assistant but from the looks of it, the job opening will only be posted next year.

Prior to joining, I expected that there would be some final boss or a walking bible from whom I could ask all my questions but turns out that is non-existent. I also did not expect how jurassic the agencys system is. Adding to the difficulty is my general adjustment and how incompetent the regional head is. (Deserves an offmyschest post). Ive set my expectations to the bare minimum but damn, this agency knows how to underperform. 

There is no repository for files. There is no existing shared drive for contracts (we dont have a records management division in the region, hurrah) - and Ive only just received my official work email last week. My first order of business is to create a repository of all case files.

Aside from that, I feel pretty lost on what needs to be prioritized given so many factors and circumstances (like getting to know co-workers. Observing office dynamics and figuring out who should be trusted ot not).

Hello!! I recently joined this group because I need some major advice and direction. I have done some university business courses but still lack 3 to complete my degree. However, I really dont like it and I dont see myself in the future being in that type of world-career wise. 

Here is what I AM interested in:
Im extremely passionate about animals (to care for, research, relationships, etc) but I have no interest in being a veterinary. I would absolutely love to be a wildlife biologist or zoologist but the idea of having to do biology courses (ironic I know) kills me. I love the environment, nature, etc. 

On the other hand I would love to open my own restaurant or business and go to culinary school. That has been another dream of mine but what is stopping me is the fact that if I decide to open a business, it will be my life and I can never have a break like a normal job. I cant just take time off and just the thought of that part sucks.

In school I absolutely did not excel at math. I enjoyed writing based classes, marketing, English, law, etc. I would love to have a job that involves stimulation, I dont want to be in a cubicle on the phone for the rest of my life. Im open to many ideas and advice, Im a 21f with a ENFJ personality type if that information changes anything. I dont mind getting dirty, I have worked on cars, worked with farm animals, electrician, plumbing, florist, Im a jack of all trades at this point so I invite any and all ideas.

I want to be some sort of writer because I love reading and language, but I also want to do mathematics/STEM because that intrigues me too (plus salary bonus which is a pretty major part of my decision).

Honestly I feel like English + Math is split very evenly right now. I always thought I'd pursue math but now I'm not so sure. I don't know if it's the pressure of my family or the pressure of myself to do it, or if it's actual genuine interest. I've done so much math that over the years I've forced myself to love it. I think I do.  I want a rewarding career w/ a high salary, so this seems like the obvious choice. I'd like it too.

But then there's English. I love to write and read stories and I've been honing my language skills over the years as well. I know the salary situation is not that good overall which is against my interests, but the subject itself I love very much.

The problem now is deciding on my undergrad major -- should I pursue math or english? I have no idea. I know there's options of changing careers frequently but honestly I don't see that happening/is kind of unrealistic. I could always do the obvious ""work a day job and then write a book in your free-time"" thing, but that doesn't sound too appealing either.

Some background:
I am very fluent in personal finance (imo for my age) and save a lot of the money I earn.
My business is revolved heavily around a current trend with the youth, and I am expecting the trend to die out eventually.
I pretty much only work, do some schoolwork, play games, and hang out with 2-3 people. Really lackluster socializing as I think Ill have time later on in life.
I feel very anxious around grades as my entire life Ive been taught to focus on grades and degrees but I see tradesmen and other ways of making a living.
My parents want me to pursue a traditional line of work for a large company. We are East Asian so you can see why they want that.
A large part of my doubts is that the business will be worthless in comparison to a masters in terms of job applications and resumes, but I feel as a business gives me opportunity to open up doors and pursue other things.

My questions are:
1.) do employers in my field (business management) see a business owner with a bachelors as more valuable and a better candidate than someone with a masters?

2.) would it be idiotic to take a plunge and go full into another business venture after college using my savings right now?

3.) what sort of careers could I look into with a decent salary with my skillset of entrepreneurship, customer service, and finance?

I'm looking for advice on my next steps in life, both professionally and personally. Here's my situation:

I'm a 30-year-old software engineer with 5.5 years of experience in backend development, working with cloud services. I have two BS degrees - one in mechanical engineering and another in computer science. I  started a masters in CS but had to step away due to work-life balance issues since I made the mistake of trying this right as the pandemic started.

Financially, I'm in a very fortunate position with about $1M+ in liquid assets and only a car loan of $25K, so I have a lot of flexibility in what I do next. I genuinely enjoy the technical aspects of my work - solving novel problems, tackling interesting challenges, and working with some of the smartest people I know. However, I'm increasingly dissatisfied with the leadership decisions at my current company which have started to seriously take a toll on my day to day happiness and excitement around work. Add on to that that we wil be instituting return to office at the beginning of the new year with a commute that is too far for me to do 5 days a week. Tangentially but still imporantantly, I'm realizing that my current work situation isn't conducive to meeting new people, particularly potential partners. This is becoming a significant concern for me as I enter my 30s.

I'm open to relocating anywhere, including internationally, and would ideally love to find a role that offers part-time or flexible work arrangements, and ideally the opprotunity for travel, but none of this is a must have deal breaker.

Really, I'm open to many possibilities - whether that's a career change, temporary work, further education, or something entirely different. I am very open to taking an unconventional path. With my financial security, I don't need to be hyper focused on the best paying or greatest likelihood of career progression, I have the opportunity to take chances, I am just not sure what to take a chance on.

Things I have considered:

* **Going back to college**, either to get/complete my masters in CS or to get another degree in a completely unrelated field (architecture, data science, investment banking, intelligence analysis, sports medicine, whatever, yolo). I could probably TA or something for intro CS/mechE to help pay for school without digging into savings too much as well as tutor. 
* **Joining the military.** Probably Airforce, not sure in what MOS but things like EOD, JTAC, or some type of combat medic role sound interesting. Mainly I am put off by the idea of having to sign a long contract (anything over 3 years), but not opposed. Relatedly, I've also considered the police academy since then there would be no contract but not sure how I feel about that one.
* **Working a seasonal job part time**, like REI or something. This seems like a pretty easy thing to do to allow me to kill some time doing something different that is far less demanding, let me take a mental break, but still keep me from getting bored. If I decide I hate it I can always jump back into the software world.
* **Volunteer w/ Disaster Relief** \- Don't really know how to go about this, but I would find it fulfilling to be boots on the ground making sure people get the help they need on their worst day. Additionally I have friends that do search and rescue (S&amp;R) and I've considering exploring that path as well.
* **Learn how to fly drones** \- I have a DJI I use for filming at some events I do. Getting licensed/certified and learning to fly profesionally would allow me to do flying for a lots of different use cases like event filming, S&amp;R, MIL/LEO, site surveys, whatever. Also seems like potential opportunity for travel.
* **Diplomatic Curiour** \- Completely random job idea, with opprotunity to live abroad. 
* **Change nothing** \- Just to be complete, I could just suck it up, deal with the commute, and continue working my current job. I would likely be a multi-millionare within the next 5 years, and able to retire fully, but honestly that does not excite me. The whole point of prioritzing school and saving so aggressively this whole time was so that when I had a family, they would never be insecure or want for anything. Without having that family, the money is pretty pointless. 

What would you do in my position? Any suggestions for careers, locations, or life changes that might align with what I'm looking for? Don't feel constrained to traditional advice - I'm genuinely open to creative and unconventional suggestions.","careerguidance",3,"https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1h3vsnh/30m_software_engineer_should_i_go_back_to_school/",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Hey Reddit,

A few months ago, I made the decision to switch jobs, and now Im struggling with a lot of regret and grief over that choice.

To give some context, I work in the legal field as in-house counsel (Ill keep the details vague). I got my law degree and qualifications earlier this year, and while I was studying, I worked for the same company in a different role and team. They promoted me to a lawyer this year after 9 years of hard work and dedication. I always believed it was my dream jobthe one Id stay in forevereven though it was my first and only job. I worked incredibly hard for every promotion, even having to negotiate a lot for a permanent role each time. Even as a Lawyer, they asked me to complete post grad qualifications (in case a role came up) and I did, but they couldnt promise me a permanent role when I finished - pretty quickly one came up when someone left. 

But soon after my promotion, everything started to fall apart. My team shrank drastically from 5 full-time employees to just myself working full time, plus two senior part-timers (2 FTE). I was still a junior, learning the ropes, with minimal mentorship from seniors who were often unavailable. I ended up managing a substantial workload of 85 clients. We were getting constant client complaints, and the seniors didnt have time to properly guide me. I feared making mistakes every day, and it took a serious toll on my mental and physical health. I was struggling to get out of bed, battling depression, and it started affecting my relationship. And on top of all this, my workplace was fully aware of a significant family trauma I was going through at the time. My other colleagues were visibly unwell with stress as well. There was promise of hiring another person to help but they didnt do so until I left. 

Things got worse when my company car, which my boss had promised to honor with the new role, was taken away. This was done to everyone in the team. The pay raise they gave me to compensate didnt even cover half the cost of what I was now responsible for, plus I had to buy a new car. The financial strain, on top of the work stress and family stress, really pushed me over the edge. I tried speaking with them about the massive impact this had, but the decision was made. I started resenting the company.  My family and friends all wanted me to leave. I was worried that one of the seniors would leave, creating further workload. 

I was in the lawyer role for about six months before I decided to leave. 

An opportunity came up at another company for a legal position in the same field that wasnt quite the same as being a lawyer, but it offered a significant pay raise$20k more, and two additional weeks of paid leave, and a much more sustainable workload with 30 clients. It also involved a project that would look great on my CV. But the tradeoff is that this company is much smaller. It is a fixed term 2 year contract (good likelihood of ongoing), the growth opportunities are limited, I no longer practice as a Lawyer, and the team are not very passionate. They cant accomplish half of what my previous company could, and its almost comical to watch. I feel like my growth will stifle in this company, and Im worried that they could fold. However, my pay and conditions are fantastic, and Im constantly appreciated for doing relatively simple work. On top of that, my mental and physical health has improved dramatically. My payout from the last company in leave paid for a car. 

Even so, I cant stop feeling like I sabotaged my career. Its been months, and I cant stop thinking about the 9 years of hard work I put in to get to the role I had, and how I seemingly threw it all away. I absolutely loved what I did. Im not getting experience as a Lawyer. Im jealous of the person who was recently promoted to my old role, and now theyve hired an additional person to help with the workload. The old place felt like family to me, and the company was so unique that I dont think Ill ever find that again. I keep thinking I should have just stuck it out a little longerit might have worked out in the end.

So, Reddit, how do I deal with this regret?","careerguidance",1,"https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1h3v427/help_please_how_to_kick_career_regret/",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Where do I go from here?","I graduated in August 2023 from a prestigious university with a double major in Business &amp; Political Science with a concentration in fintech. I started job searching in February 2023, and after nearly a year of effort and thousands of applications, I finally landed a full-time job in February 2024. Unfortunately, the role I secured in accounts payable has turned out to be extremely repetitive, monotonous, and low-paying.

For the past 10 months, the lack of challenge, growth opportunities, and human interaction in this position has significantly impacted my mental health. Ive tried to pivot by interviewing for other roles, including financial analyst and consulting positionsboth of which align more closely with my interests and long-term goalsbut I wasnt selected. I did get through to about the 3rd / 4th rounds of interviews.

Now, I feel stuck. Should I keep pushing forward with job applications, even though the process is so draining? Or should I consider pursuing further certifications, like the CFA or CFP, to enhance my qualifications? Though im aware a bachelors isnt worth much anymore in the market these days, m hesitant to go back to studying again because I had hoped my degree alone would help me secure a fulfilling job.

I love business &amp; finance, and I also particularly enjoy any industry in tech, cars, or anything that involves human interaction.

My dad scolded me on planning to quit same-day (at will state, 30 yo, gave this org 5 years of my 20s, good ol boys club environment with screaming and offensive comments, nonstop conservative politics). This will ensure I witness my earned bonus from the last year and my two months retroactive pay increase IN MY BANK ACCOUNT. If I give a week notice (much better job starts following week and I did not want to delay it any further so I can escape my job and attend the new job's holiday party)- there is a high chance of passive aggressive, abusive language and either firing me next day and/or ""forgetting/rescinding"" my bonus and back pay raise.

  
Instead of feeling bad, recovering emotionally from that, being short literally $3000 of earned wages and fussing with an employment lawyer when I am supposed to be celebrating my new job and having a relaxed mind all week, I am choosing to give one-day notice (politely and professionally citing ""medical, personal and professional reasons"" and directing them to a server folder with prepped work and training documents for my tasks).

  
I could really use some support and encouragement. My own father questioned my ""character"" saying ""it was the wrong thing to do."" This is the same guy who left me behind with a literal child abuser at 9yo aside from child support and a few visits per year. Child protective services rescued me from her out of the hospital just before turning 18.

I don't want to hear about ""morals and character"" from someone who is willing to let me be abused by both my mom and this workplace. He said if I give my notice and THEN they act pissy about it, I can move it up to that day. How is that ""moral"" but ignoring 3.5 years of abuse leading up to the notice permissable, and I am immoral for doing same day from the jump? Ugh.

I am an adult. This is an at-will employment state. My boss has reminded me of this repeatedly as some sort of weird, passive-aggressive threat despite positive performance review. I am just spending 3 days of my weekend stressed when I should be celebrating the new offer which is +25% pay, paid holidays, PTO, remote flexibility and higher seniority. Something the good old boy's club refuses to give me and has promoted my male peer above us women peers who have the same responsibilities and been on the same time. Except she is treated worse in the sense that they question if she will have more kids, including our new ""supervisor"" at her anniversary lunch.... I am not tied down and I want my $3000 I am owed Friday, then quit same-day and never look back. In terms of references, I could get several but after 4 years of sacrificing my mental health and career progression in an attempt to endear myself to ""good old boys"", I am ready to walk. The senior mgrs has made suicide, rape, terrorism, gender based and school shooting ""jokes"" in office just in the last 4 months alone. He used to wink at me for a year straight until I started staring straight ahead with my earbuds in.

Im considering taking a trade to be an  automobile mechanic but Ive never even tried anything having to do with fixing a car. All I know is that it seems fun. Is that even worth it? Some people say the moneys good, others say its shit. I also dont know if Id like it because I hated my wood working and CAD engineering class. Then again, Im not sure if those things relate to being a mechanic&

Overall, Im not sure what to go into. I love science to a degree, but doubt Im gonna make it thru a doctorate. Might be self esteem talking tho, I cant tell. Maybe its senioritis.

Do I go thru with some sort of science doctorate, or jump into that mechanic trade? Are there any other options for me? Im so lost its kinda scary lol.

It's only been a few days that I've been working at this company, and to be entirely honest, I do not know my job title. It's a very informal business but I'm clocking in and they're formal enough to pay me for my time.

My dream job involves software engineering and this sort of feels like it, with the perks of very low expectations and very high autonomy.

I should also mention that due to how ill-defined my tasks are, I'm not entirely sure of how long I will be tasked to do this.

I am based in california (went to a california community college) so my question is would I be able to switch majors into a different engineering field with most of my credits completed at a community college? Or am I going to have to start over again from square 1? I think my university has a credit limit where if its above 90 in a certain major you can't switch if you are a transfer student. So I would probably have to switch majors and start in community college, but hopefully not from scratch. Does anyone know about the college system here and what I could do?

So Im seeking some advice. Weve got a temporary team leader whos been pretty bad overall (Ill call her L). But one of the worst parts is that L openly criticizes people who have trained or supported her. It first started with L criticizing the person who trained her for 3 months; she brought this up in my 1-1 when I asked a question that I think she didnt have the answer to (it became a X didnt train me in this so I dont know). I was uncomfortable but at least felt like she was punching in her own weight class. 

I just tried to re-direct the conversation and ignore it. However, since then, L has openly criticized 3 other people in acting deputy team leader roles. She has done this in group chats and in meetings. Quite frankly, Im sick of it and think its pretty inappropriate. And most of my team agrees. Were short-staffed so people are stepping into deputy team leader roles to help her, while she was hired to be in the team leader role. 

Im planning on addressing it with her individually before raising it with anyone above her. Im planning on just simply saying that it makes me uncomfortable to hear her criticize my peers, especially when were all being expected to act up because of staffing shortages. That it makes me concerned about what criticism Ill receive when its my turn. 

Anyone have any thoughts of anything else I should say? I expect shell be a bit defensive. Im not worried about this changing my own job stability.

I'd love to know more languages, but I can't get beyond A2 myself (tried it with german). 

I tried doing amateur translations of songs, games and poetry requested by my friends (I didn't care at all about the things I was translating) and it seems like a thing I might enjoy to do as a career. I like the process itself, all the quirks and challenges while adapting something to another language and culture are fascinating to me. However, I've never treated translation seriously, I was always told by my family that everyone knows english and can just machine translate other languages if needed. That's why I never considered translation as a career up until recently.

I came to conclusion that, considering my grades, interests and overall qualities, I could either be an average engineer/data analyst or a good translator.

That's why I want to ask: is it a good idea to get a degree in translation/linguistics and try to have a career in translating? Or should I go for something with more stable job prospects?

If I go for a translation degree, I think I'd pick one wide-spoken language (arabic or chinese) and one or two less spoken ones (like persian, hebrew, japanese, azerbaijani or korean). I'd probably try to get a job in technical/medical translation or localization.

Firstly, I mentioned numerous times in the interview process that culture is very important to me and they did a song and dance about how much they do to nurture theirs. However once I started, I realised how unengaged most people are and the majority of employees are considerably older, so there is borderline 0 socialising. In addition, the company had a mass layoff a year ago and is still going through small restructures, so the morale is incredibly low. Secondly, despite being at a senior level, my manager does not provide me any space to thought lead and edits/dismisses any of my suggestions or approaches to anything. Thirdly, the content itself is incredibly dry. I was suspecting as much going into SaaS, but I figured the culture would make up for it, of which there is none. And lastly, the company is incredibly hierarchical and moves at a snail's pace. Something I have never experienced in tech before.

I was originally meant to accept a role at a B2C company, but it was a contract role (no benefits) with much lower pay and they had screwed me around for 2 months in the recruitment process, so it seemed like a no brainer to take the B2B role when they counteroffered since it was a perm role for far more money and a very straightforward recruitment process. But now Im wondering if I made the wrong decision as the job at the B2C company seemed far more interesting and the people way more up my alley.

I'm considering sticking it out for 6 months and then resuming my job hunt. Does this look terrible on my resume and how do I spin this for interviewers? I stayed in my previous role for 3 years before the redundancy and 4 years in my role before that, so I haven't 'jumped around' in quite sometime.","careerguidance",8,"https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1h3m6dl/having_regrets_over_the_new_job_i_chose_what_to_do/",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Also took a break from college after going to school for so long in life when i went back is when i got into grad school. I needed a job so my sister let me know about couple jobs and one was for after school program, in which after working my way up im currently a supervisor. I did think about teaching but also interested in being a professor one day down in my life. I also dreamt about being a doctor and working animals as veterinarian when i was young in a school field trip but i know that career path pretty hash from stories i heard. Also was interested in medical field in general since my mom had cancer we took care of her and found i should go towards medical field. I know my mom would've told me whatever i chose she would back me up and follow that path. Which i thought about p.a. but i know there's pre reqs and patient hours to do but my i cant leave my current job since it pays well and i pay a portion of the rent with my siblings. This where im stuck i feel like i got great opportunities and routes to take but I'm just not sure and i need a job to pay my bills so again any advice?

"2597","2024-11-30",1732999084,"Graduating college but regret not going trades route. What are my options?","As the title says, I like many ignorant high school students was deluded into thinking the university path was the only path that existed if you wanted a stable livelihood. I didn't really know the trades existed until a few years ago. I thought your options were college or dead-end retail job for life pretty much, and acted accordingly. Instead of transferring directly to my state university, I got basic credits done in community college for 2 years first and then went. The pandemic complicated things a bit, and now instead of graduating at 23, I'll graduate with my B.S in engineering at 26.

In my time at university, I've come to slowly regret making this choice and not going the trades route immediately after high school. I'm not interested in working at a top tech company like Google or Facebook. I don't have family with connections. I'm really just interested in learning hands on skills that are valuable and make decent money---enough money for me to escape poverty and build a better life for myself. With how oversaturated tech degrees are becoming with AI, I feel like I could have accomplished my financial goals years earlier had I learned a trade such as plumbing, electrician, HVAC, carpentry, etc.

Obviously I'm going to finish my degree. It'd be foolish to give up now with all the debt I've accrued. But I just feel a little clueless as to where I go from here. I want to learn skills that make me as versatile as possible and able to weather economic downturns in the future.

"2600","2024-11-30",1732997576,"Would it be a good idea to leave my current position, for a potentially lower one?","I've been at my current position for over 2 years now. I was fresh out of college, and it was in a team where they wanted to raise someone up for AI work they were doing. The pay was good, and I was very optimistic. To be blunt the work environment is toxic, and I don't think I'm gonna advance much in this position. Much of the upper management has there own agenda, and I've caught them hiding code, and hardware for projects I am on. That they have tried to play off as being open about it, but things very clearly have added up, and talking to other coworkers about this they have said this has been typical.

I've been offered a position thats kind of lower than I'd want. Its essentially a higher-manager IT position. I'd receive slightly more pay (around 5k more). They've also promised to pay for some certifications that would assist in the job. The health insurance is much better (300 deductible, and 10 copay). Then retirement has about the same.

This position though feels kind of like a step back. They have mentioned other positions in the company that could become available that I could interview for. But its not sure when they would come available. I have friends who work at that company, and vouch for it I'd be given a chance. So I do believe them that they aren't trying to jip me.

After college, I received a full-time offer from a small wedding company to produce wedding films and manage their social media. However, after a couple of years, I became burnt out because the work felt monotonous and lacked opportunities for career growth.

This is the second job where I have this impostor syndrome, first time round went counselling, found the initial issue was something childhood related.

This job, I used to absolutely love, I work in banking with senior execs, fast paced and really interesting. I get a bird-eye view of everything happening in this major organisation and across the industry really eye opening. I work from home, I'm paid well though my team is more senior than I am

This is where the issue lies, I am very proactive, tunnel vision you might say focused on the task, but always got positive feedback...but because of that I say yes to a lot and feel so invisible. Because of working from home, because English isn't my main language and I don't feel very confident when standing my ground it's just easier to agree. I think when I'm trying to come across to these senior execs I ALWAYS have to be at my best, they don't have time to waste. I might come across direct, my job is always about message positioning and lines to take etc and they don't like direct talk.

I just think I need a change, have been here 3 years and I feel anyone in my team calling to speak to me is for when something isn't going well, there's no recognition. I used to be a high performer and always got great ratings in previous roles so ...being just average where I am it just doesn't sit right. I can't say my team are super competent but they're not as honest and transparent, they seem busy..but you know busy work not actually doing much because they ask me to do it for them.

I had a few busy months as well  at work and didn't take time off to be there...now in December I took some weeks off to not lose my annual leave and been called for it :( I just don't think they have a good opinion of my performance and work attitude, no matter how much I try to prove myself


I think I want to get out but the job market in the UK in my field is pants..I have 2yrs experience in fin crime ...4 yrs experience in compliance+ICA diploma, 3 yrs experience in Risk and about 3yrs here, so I feel I don't have deep experience in one field to find the same seniority in something related, but I'd take a pay cut to re-train

Given all the job benefits and pay am I mad to look for something else or just suck it up?

"2608","2024-11-30",1732993078,"Burnt out as a healthcare manager  what should I go next?","Hey yall. This might be a little bit of a vent post, but also looking for genuine advice. Any help is appreciated in advanced.

For the past three years, I have been a manager in a specialty medical clinic, overseeing our team of ~20 schedulers. I fell into my role because I wanted to go to medical school, and started as a scheduler to get experience for my application. I didnt get into school, but I stuck with it and eventually was able to get promoted to my role. In retrospect, Im glad I didnt get into medical school because I am happy where I currently am in my personal life; if I had gone to medical school, my life would be very different.

I am feeling very mentally/emotionally drained by my role for two primary reasons:
1) healthcare is quite strained in my area: too many patients, not enough providers, etc. I take the majority of our complaint calls in our clinic, so I have to hear quite a bit of negative feedback that I have little to no control over.
2) My team is quite short-staffed and we are unable to hire new staff due to a hiring freeze. Because of this, I am often filling in when people are sick or on vacation. With a team of ~20, its a real treat to have everyone in for a string of 2-3 days.

Because of the above, everything feels like an emergency that needs to be managed now. Part of this is my own perception, but its difficult to not feel like Im in fight-or-flight.

I am interesting in maybe pivoting to a role outside of healthcare, but I am unsure what that would be. I have a B.S. in biochemistry, all my post-college work experience has been in the healthcare field (7 years total: scribe, scheduler, manager). I see the applicable skills of people/project management, but when I look at project management positions, I feel under-qualified.

Ive thought about going back to school, but Im not really sure what I would go back to school for. I dont have any particular passions or interests to pursue. Even if I did go back to school, it would need to be a part-time program  we are unable to afford our mortgage on one income.

I think Im just feeling a little lost and would appreciate any advice or wisdom from yall.","careerguidance",7,"https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1h3jkfj/burnt_out_as_a_healthcare_manager_what_should_i/",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
