Keep that in mind. Many people are experiencing this. Just keep going, keep applying. Try not to become attached to a job. 

You may also want to reach out to people who may already have a job youd be interested in. Ask them how they broke in. 

Most of finding a new job is just a matter of putting yourself out there. You have a little business, that business is you, so youre going to have to market yourself, and dont give up until you reach your goal. 

You got this!!!! Try a strategy for a week, if its not working, pick another strategy, optimize each process. This is how business works.","1"

However, there isn't an ideal timing for you to give that notice, it would actually be better late than never. Also, don't forget that your next employer is waiting for you to start when you can unless they are really flexible with it, which is a rare case. Start worrying about your next employer vs. the current one you're going to leave. 

The reason why I'm saying that is because I don't want you to potentially lose your next opportunity by trying to be considerate of your current job. I'm not sure how your relationship with your current manager is but regardless how you say it, it may just be burning a bridge.

Employers don't like the ""owning your own company"" thing because it feels like you're going not going to focus 100% on the job and focus more on your own business. To be honest, you should be focusing on your own company more because it's YOURS, but employers care about their own best self interests, not their employees. If it's something like gig work, it's part time and can be done anytime so it matters way less. 

Self employment can also mean so many things from working gig work like you mentioned or having a full side business along with your full time job. Hence, it's just best not to mention it unless your self employment work is some sort of freelancing work that is relevant to your job when you weren't employed. 

For example, I work full time and own a resume writing/career coaching business on the side, there's no way I would mention that in my resume since employers might think it's a conflict of interest.

I get the dead end job feeling. You have 30 more years to go &amp; the last thing you want is to feel miserable waking up every day. But is that because of your job or because you have intervertally isolated yourself. You have a stay at home job &amp; sound like no one at home. Are you going out with friends frequently? Pursuing hobbies w/ others? You need at least 1 hr being in another location doing something you enjoy. If you don't, you will feel awful.

It is a risk, drastically different from your current job, &amp; will take a long time to become stable. I would at the very least shadow you friend for a week or two to get the feeling of the prospective job.

TLDR: I would sit down and introspect on what you really want out of your future. Passion in job or Passion in hobby that job supports.

I have a serious girlfriend, a good group of friends, and too many hobbies to count (cycling, tennis, golf, lifting, shooting guns, hiking, etc) which really helps. 

I won't say IRE is a passion, but an interesting and exciting opportunity to re-invent myself, grow my network, work hard with a great friend, and set myself up for a greater future if I can stick it out. We're both very entrepreneurial, and have always wanted to start a business together... he has said to me this could be the beginning of that before we start our own brokerage or invest in IRE ourselves down the road. I see the vision too, and everyone I talk to in his industry just seems overall more happy than 99% of the people I know in corporate.","3_1"

Sometimes it's an interview/intern style process (from both sides) which should follow with some security either in commitments, draw, salary + commission or some success. I cap those engagements to 90 days before moving forward or cutting my losses. And it's always part-time.

They should understand as grown men that we can't afford to go without income for extended periods, whether it's them or someone else cutting the check. If it's truly performance based (commission only) with an existing business, then they should be able to provide a path to success based on historic data. I.e. ""at the bare minimum, the average nitwit can get x amount of output for x amount of input over x amount of time. You can use that as a reference over 90 days to gauge whether or not they're full of it. If they don't have that, don't take them seriously. If they're serious, then a willingness to invest in you by the bare due diligence with some hand holding or draw expresses good faith. When push comes to shove, if someone won't even put a contract in front of you, they're bluffing.

What incentive does your buddy have in letting you into the owner's book that he's supposed to inherit? What incentive does the owner have in giving you his book? Is he taking an override?

If you're still not dissuaded, then offer to work with them on the prospecting side and take a % on deals. They should be able to cut you in for the value of that, which at the very least offers a win-win by filling their pipeline and let's you investigate the offer plus some spiffs without quitting your day job. If they're impossible to deal with during that time, then they're not serious.

Mostly serving tables and bartending. I now run a team for a health insurance company.

There are a TON of transferable skills that aren't necessarily ""resume"" skills. Communication, public speaking, multitasking, etc. 

I will say I worked in restaurants forever because I was going to school and also my life was a roller coaster. It's a fantastic way to make enough money to pay your school, bills, rent etc. and only work 25-35 hours a week and the hours don't directly conflict with school hours. I also think it's not the worst place to end up working - you can live/move ANYWHERE and make a livable wage, but as others have said, it's always the best career long term.

One day you will likely take a pay cut, but it'll end up giving you benefits (401k, health, vision, dental, PTO, etc.) and then eventually you'll end up making more. 

I can confidently say I look back and realize that working in restaurants was one of the most fun times of my life. Lots of freedom, lots of friends, lots of fun and goofing. Enjoy it. Become OK with the fact that you're making good money at 23 and if you go to school, get comfortable being there a while during school years and build good relationships for shifts/swaps/etc.","12"

You sound like you want more meaning to your life and purpose. I'll tell you now that the easy money doesn't last forever. If you enjoy being a waiter and aspects of it cool. Work your way up the chain! I have friends that worked in restaurants for a minute, moved up, and became manager. Some of them like it some don't. The one's that don't often find themselves limited to what they can do next with their experience. 

  
I highly suggest you get a degree/trade school. One thing I realize now that I didn't realize before is that piece of paper will open doors for you. During this financial crisis of 2023-2024 job searching has been extremely picky with their applicants. Even though I was more than qualified in my industry many applications required a degree.

Bonus tip: you dont have to have that much money saved up to start this process if you can find what you want to buy at a steep discount.

TLDR EDIT: save up as much money as you can while you consider it to be easy. Invest that money in other things to make more money for yourself.","25"

Id suggest finding something within business that sparks your interest, like finance, marketing etc, and from that seek work experience schemes and connecting with professionals via LinkdIn and gaining knowledge about specific job roles and what you can do to gain experience.

At your age its normal to not have loads of knowledge about business and what you actually want to do. A lot of the time thats what college is designed for.  

For me personally I went into uni majoring in philosophy and then decided to change to a joint honours in philosophy And politics.

honestly both paths can be great - but here's the real deal: with how AI is transforming both industries, the traditional barriers between marketing and finance are becoming less rigid. for example, a lot of the complex math in finance is now handled by AI tools, while marketing is becoming more data-driven but also more creative.

if you hate math but love creativity, stick with marketing. here's why:

* marketing is evolving into a super creative field with AI handling the analytical heavy lifting
* you can always learn finance concepts later (especially with AI tools helping you understand complex topics)
* your natural creativity is actually becoming MORE valuable as AI takes over routine tasks

quick tip: start playing around with AI tools for both marketing and finance while youre still in school. they can help you understand both fields better and see which one clicks more with you. at my company we see marketing folks using AI for creative campaigns and finance people using it for complex calculations - its pretty cool seeing how both fields are evolving

but yeah if math gives you anxiety stick with marketing. your creative thinking will be worth gold, especially as AI continues to change the industry. just make sure to stay tech-savvy!","1"

The truth is, you dont need to be a math whiz to succeed in marketing, and with the rise of digital tools, you can thrive in areas like branding, content creation, social media strategy, or even UX research. That said, you will need to have a strong portfolio and internships. On the flip side, finance can lead to solid career opportunities too, but if you hate math, itll probably be a struggle, and you wont enjoy the work as much. Remember, both degrees can lead to fulfilling careers, but excelling in your field is easier if you actually like what youre doing.

To answer your other question, you can absolutely work in finance-related roles with a marketing degree, especially in areas like financial product marketing or sales. Since youre weighing your options, you might want to check out the GradSimple newsletter.

I work for the government.  My Gross Earnings are about $20K less than if I was in the Private Sector.

On the Other hand

My healthcare insurance plan is $120 per month cost to me for 2 people, with no deductible and no copay.  
My Vacation time after 5 years of service - 7 weeks  
Holidays - I get the odd ones like June 19th off, Veterans, Memorial, July 4th, etc  
Pension Plan  
401K Plan with 100% Match  
Hybrid work schedule  2 days in office, 3 days working from home  
I can set my hours to a point  
No real Supervisor or manager or Director hovering over my shoulder

Would I give that all up to receive $20K more per year with just  
15 days vacation, no pension, lower 401K Match if any at all  
Less Holidays off, and not being able to work from home or set my hours?

NO - 

More money can't buy happiness or peace of mind  
Learning to live with what you bring home is the KEY

I live in DEBT FREE meaning I don't have massive credit card debt, and if I do they are paid off in 30 days.

My car is paid for, my house mortgage is reasonable, I cut other expenses like Cable TV, and I don't dine out as often as I like ...but on the other hand, I am building my savings to live a better life in 6 years.

Less time in the car in traffic, and more time at home doing what I enjoy is more important than money.

I work so I can live, I don't live to work.","1"

1. Customer Success Manager - especially in tech companies. you'd help customers get the most value from products/services. pays better than traditional customer service too
2. Technical Support Specialist - if you enjoy the problem-solving aspect. your warehouse experience could be valuable here since you understand physical products
3. Client Solutions Consultant - kinda like what youre doing now but more strategic. lots of companies need people who can actually understand customer needs and translate them into solutions
4. AI Customer Experience Specialist - this is pretty new but growing fast. you'd work with both customers and AI tools to provide better service. your natural empathy would be super valuable here since u actually care about helping people (unlike your current coworkers lol)

the best part about these roles is that they usually come with better pay and growth opportunities than traditional customer service. plus most companies are desperate for people who genuinely care about helping customers (seriously rare these days)","1"

1. the most successful professionals in their 50s are those who became ""tech-enabled experts"" - they combine their deep industry knowledge with modern tech/AI capabilities. its not about becoming a programmer, but rather knowing how to leverage new tools to increase their value
2. build a strong personal brand on linkedin. sounds cliche but seriously - older professionals who actively share their expertise/experiences tend to have more opportunities come their way. employers value thought leadership
3. focus on advisory/consulting roles where age + experience is actually an advantage. many companies need seasoned professionals who can guide strategic decisions
4. stay current with industry trends but dont try to compete with 20-somethings on execution tasks. instead position yourself as someone who can mentor/guide teams while providing strategic oversight

btw if ur interested in the tech/AI part, i can share some specific examples of how professionals are using AI to enhance their value. ive seen some really creative approaches that completely changed their career trajectory

also, if you want objective feedback about your appearance and potential improvements (both surgical and non-surgical), you might want to try using AI image analysis. i actually built jenova ai which has really good image analysis capabilities - you can upload photos and it gives detailed, objective feedback about facial features and potential improvements. its completely private and might give you better insights than random people online

for example, you can use AI to:

* learn bookkeeping concepts by having it explain things in simple terms
* get feedback on your social media posts
* create project management templates
* practice CRM scenarios
* analyze successful social media marketing campaigns

i actually built jenova ai partially because i wanted to help people learn skills faster. its pretty good at explaining complex topics in simple ways + you can ask followup questions until you really understand something

but regardless of what tools you use, i think your progression from VA  social media marketing  building an agency is solid. just make sure to document everything you learn along the way, itll be super valuable when your training your future team!

From everything you're saying here, you've decided for yourself that you're not good enough without letting any professionals within the field decide - why not give it a go and see what _they_ have to say? 

&gt;I am worthless by comparison

Disagree - but why bother making the comparison? You're not in competition.

&gt; it doesnt matter about my skills.

It 100% does.

&gt;I shouldnt be starting at an age where Im supposed to have a family and own a house.

You **have** a portfolio, a set of things which you've produced and achieved - it was created in a different field, so marketing it here will be a challenge. But you worked in marketing, so figure out a way to do that.

If you're aiming for a career change, nobody will expect 100% relevance, but there absolutely will be relevant aspects that you can focus on.","1_1_1_1_1"

You can lament that youve wasted a decade of your life, or you can realize that at the end of the day, the days gonna end, and did you get any closer to where you want to be?

Im 35, and if there is one thing Ive learned in my life is that its NEVER too late to start over. Never. 

At 30 I was living in my mothers basement- careerless, depressed, and dangerously suicidal. Id gotten expelled from grad school twice, fired from my nonprofit job, and convinced I would die a loser and family disappointment. The only income I had was made by driving for Lyft and substitute teaching a few times a week. Fast forward 5 years and Ive gone to a 3-month UX bootcamp and gotten a job as a product designer at a major tech company making nearly $200k annually (started at $90k, got 2 promotions and multiple salary adjustments over 3 years at the company). I couldve given up- I wanted to, many times. But I knew that nothing I was doing was a waste because it was moving me *somewhere* away from where Id been the day before, and I believed in myself enough to know Id eventually see the destination and be glad I moved forward at all, even if it was an inch at a time. 

Start today. Do not think about other people. Focus on bettering yourself today over where you were yesterday. If you focus on only beating yourself you will literally never think of yourself as a failure. And you need to think of yourself this way if youre going to love yourself out of this miserable place youve admitted you are in. Reframing your perspective will be absolutely fundamental for your survival- please take it from someone whos been there and has clawed her way out.","1_1_1_1_2"

In my space the average timeline to get a new role was 3 months, but some of my roles would take up to 9 months to fill. 

This is a difficult time to get a job in banking, as most banks will be on a hiring freeze until new budgets are released in march - once annual bonuses are paid. But some unofficial interviews will be starting already, so Id start networking with relevant hiring managers that will have future headcounts. Most official interviews (via HR) wont start until march, so thats likely your earliest start date, unless they are desperate for your skill set. 

As a first point of call, Id call up headhunters to see what is available in your space and how much activity there is (due-diligence is key, reputable firms only) whos expanding teams, who has headcounts but now and expected to in march. 

When I had candidates who had moved recently, many of the hiring managers were flexible to meet after hours / during lunch. Youll have to push back on headhunters for flexible interviews (not for senior staff like global heads, youd have to make yourself available, but if its got to that stage, youre in a good position to get the job regardless) 

It will be seen as a red flag for hiring managers leaving after 3 months. So youd want a good reason, but you should steer clear of insulting your current firm too much, aiming for a better firm should be your pitch, headhunter contacted you and you cant miss a once in a lifetime opportunity to work for a better firm etc but appreciate how it looks.. acknowledge it before they make assumptions.

Not sure whether this helps as you may be in a completely different space! 

Sorry to hear youre struggling in your new role, I had a string of horrendous firms this year and have taken time out (I have no co dependants, so it was an easier decision to make), working in finance is challenging and mentally draining, so please take care of yourself during the little free time you have.

First off, I just want to say you're not aloneso many people have been in a similar spot, and it's okay to feel conflicted about this.

Its great that you have 68 months of savings, so youve got some breathing room if you decide to take a step back. If your mental health is really suffering, it might be worth considering leaving and taking some time to find a role that actually fits you. The 3-month stint isnt ideal, but you can spin it in interviews as a learning experiencesomething like, It wasnt the right cultural fit, but it taught me a lot about what Im looking for in my next role.

If quitting feels too risky right now, maybe you could carve out some time to job search quietly. Even just sending out a couple of applications a week can give you options without completely burning yourself out.

Also, since you had good relationships at your last job, maybe reach out to some old colleagues or mentors. Who knows, they might know of opportunities or be willing to recommend you somewhere.

At the end of the day, your mental health matters. Its tough to carry the weight of being the main provider, but youll show up so much better for your family if youre in a role that doesnt drain you every day.

Maybe I didnt share enough details, but I just wanted to get straight to the point. Some more context for others to understand: 

1. My burnout has gotten bad to the point that I cannot sleep well, Ive lost weight, and Im constantly irritable. 
2. Quiet quitting is a good suggestion, but doing the bare minimum is not even possible with my bosses incredibly high standards. Everything I do is wrong and I get scolded for it. Ive tried ways to just fade into the background and avoid interaction / scolding, but its impossible with the projects Ive been assigned to. For me to just avoid the endless scolding, I cannot allow myself time to rest. 

Why Im asking how to break it to my manager:
Where I work, it doesnt work to just send an email stating whatever reason. Maybe its a difference in culture, but they will probe to no end.

In my last job, I stated that I was leaving for personal reasons. They werent satisfied and kept probing.  

I just want to be able to share a reason that they will 
1. accept without negotiation
2. believe and not doubt (because in my prev workplace, they started gossiping about my personal reasons)

I would definitely resign after the holidays and ensure I give them the appropriate notice.

My preference would always be to have a job lined up, even if I was taking a break between jobs, especiallyin this market. You can negotiate your start date with most employers. So i would find my next job then give my notice and my start date would be notice plus break.

In regards to the second part, I would be honest but use a very professional tone and language. Instead of saying to toxic environment, you can say something like I don't fit in with some of my colleagues here as it seems certain individuals like calling out people and also seem to engage in office politics and this doesn't align with my way of working.

This way you're saying the same thing but you're not blaming everyone in the company and the wording is less direct and it makes it more likely to be received as constructive feedback rather than venting. Hopefully if they hear this from enough people it might encourage them to change and you'd have played dour part in that.

Anyway good luck with everything!","22"

The fact is that in matter of months you are out of job anyway - likely, possibly. 

This 3 month role is the kind of role that will open you opportunities that you would not get without this 3 month role. 

What is your buffer financially speaking? Lets say you take the 3 month role, you downgrade absolutely everything you possibly can and live on as little money as possible. How much realistically can you save? These savings plus what you already have - how many months can you sustain yourself? 

In business and in life theres one rule: bigger the risk, bigger the reward. 

If I would have financial buffer for 3 months - that solves the problem doesnt it? Then you have either 6 months in your current job, 3 months in the new one plus 3 month financial buffer to support yourself. 

6 months and 6 months. 

If this is the case, I would not even think twice but then again, Im quite comfortable also taking risks. 

The 3 month job will not be for nothing regardless. You will learn what you wont learn in your current one. Think of it as your intellectual asset. You can ALWAYS benefit from intellectual asset.","1"

Learn Python by actually practicing the language and doing projects. You have some prior coding experience, so picking up a new language shouldn't be some ordeal. Especially if you want to learn it in the context of data analysis, your prior experience should help you feel things out. But, pick projects that seem interesting and useful, maybe contribute to open source projects, and learn by doing. 

That's not to say you can ignore Leetcode, I just want to be clear about the purpose of everything. Leetcode isn't there to teach you how to be good at Python. It's there so you can learn the little tricks and problems that you'll be interviewed on, even though they have nothing to do with the job itself. It's a separate thing from actually learning python in order to \*do\* the job you want. Leetcode is only to \*get\* the job you want. 

In any case, treat Leetcode like a habit, grind out some problems everyday, and you'll have lots of experience in two or three years. Treat the projects as the method you use to actually learn python.

first off - the eye strain issue is actually pretty common but totally fixable! get yourself a good blue light filter (either glasses or screen), adjust your screen brightness, and follow the 20-20-20 rule (every 20 mins look at something 20 feet away for 20 secs). these small changes made a huge difference for me.

given your love for math, problem-solving, and working independently, i think you're actually on the right track with data analytics! but here's something interesting to consider - have you thought about getting into AI/ML? its basically the perfect combo of math, problem solving, and analytics. plus with all the new AI tools coming out (like jenova ai which i built), theres huge demand for people who can work with these systems.

business analysis could work too but tbh its usually more about processes and stakeholder management than pure analytics. if you really enjoy the mathematical side of things, you might find it a bit limiting.

quick suggestion - try playing around with some AI tools to analyze data and see if you enjoy it. its a good way to test the waters without committing to anything. most modern AI platforms can help with data analysis, and seeing how they work might give you better insight into what aspects of the field interest you most.","2"

In my community, I often see people posting asking about animal grooming and nail cutting. At least in the state I live in, you don't need any certification or license to be a dog groomer. You'd have to check with your state laws, and even if there aren't legal requirements, you would probably want to set up an LLC and create it as a business (relatively easy and inexpensive). I also see a lot of people asking for dog training - again, you may not need a license or certification for this - though receiving one will help credibility. 

You're good at art - combine this with your passion of animals - do commission work for pet portraits. 

You have a lot going on, so in proceeding, make it scalable - but I see potentially a combination of going to school online/part time for vet tech, do animal grooming as a job, and then art on the side.

Offices exist to run repeated processes, tasks are grouped by similarity which allows for accumulation of experience through repetition across time. It's efficient.

This doesn't imply all processes are necessarily *hateful*, you may very well enjoy what you do. It's just that it is bound to become repetitive after a while.

The comment about startups is accurate: the more immature the company, the more of a messy mixup it will be - the downside is the stress and intensity of living in a boiling pot all the time. As the company matures, the mess will be sorted out to discard the useless and keep only what works, which will be formalized into processes as efficient, effective, repetitive and boring processes - the mess means wasted money.","5"

I think your framework is a little off. If you look at peoples resumes you will see that they have held variety of jobs over the course of their careers. You get a job you learn it, when it stops being interesting you grow or change. Along the way, your life can change. Maybe you become comfortable and risk averse. Maybe you have responsibilities that make it difficult for you to make changes. 

People get stuck often due to circumstances outside of their control. For me, I have always found it helpful to just move towards things I am interested in. For example I dislike boring, repetitive tasks and work to automate them when possible. Soon I become a specialist in this and my role changes. I have never worked on a team where there was not room for process improvement. 

Look for roles and teams that are a good fit for you. Some people like structure and predictability some like not knowing what is around the next corner. There is no good and bad there is just suitable and not suitable for you. Different companies/teams can tackle the same task in using completely different approaches.   Find your tribe. 

Always have a goal  somewhere out in the future, what do you want your life to be like in 5 years. Move in that direction. Reevaluate every year and change the goal as you change but always keep challenge as a part of your life.","21"

It just sounds like they really need someone--you might even have room to negotiate a higher salary. 

If you put yourself in the managers shoes, offloading tasks is literally why you hire people. Have you ever worked somewhere and had wait too much work on your plate? The issue is typically that there's too much work for the number of staff, so to rectify that, it's good that they're hiring someone.

About the empty office--are some people allowed to work hybrid or remote? That would be a great question for them if you don't know yet--literally asking why the office seemed empty is fine! 

The only hesitation I would have is, and this is going to sound kind of bad, but are they always desperate and just hiring anyone? That could be indicative of larger issues and even put into question whether this is a high performing team/company that's trying to get good talent. That's only really a concern if you want to stay there long term versus early in your career and just trying to get experience. If it's the latter, no biggie, you can move on in a year.

Depends on where you're claiming asylum. Since you're still in a closet, it's unclear if you have sufficient evidence at the moment. Contact LGBT non-profit organizations in the country that you're thinking or consult a lawyer to see if this is a viable option or not. 

&gt;2) keep working til I get an offer from somewhere else, but that might take years.. 

You still need to financially support yourself so makes sense to do this until you have better options.

&gt;3) university, I've saved enough for that

You didn't mention the country, but this is typically the easiest and most direct way to immigrate for a lot of countries and usually have some pathways to work and then gain permanent residency. I think this is probably the most ideal imo because it doesn't tie your immigration status to your trans identity and you can come out at your own time if and when you feel safe in your new community. 

&gt;4) a friend wants to marry me, but I'll then be in the US and that's scary. Does open doors though. 

If this is not a true marriage but a charity gesture from your friend, it's technically immigration fraud and I wouldn't recommend it. Especially when you're trans and middle eastern in an anti-immigration anti-trans trump administration. If your ""marriage"" is scrutinized sufficiently and you're discovered to commit marriage fraud for immigration purposes, both you and your friend will suffer consequences.","17"

Something to consider, and you can reject this since I dont know the full scope of your disabilities, is to be open to in-office accommodations vs straight up requiring working from home. If theres a short commute or they offer transportation or a carpool program, maybe you can come to the office. The temperature thing is also a big assumption, not every office will be extremely cold and to the uneducated might sound like a jacket or something like that can take care of it. 

Basically, dont just assume recruiters will take your word for it especially with some of the details you provide. Businesses are businesses, therefore they lack empathy.

I have worked many many jobs, everything from dealing with animal waste to a cozy office job with a window seat, performing computer tasks.

When I see a ""problem"" or an issue that hinders production, (whatever the end goal is ), and I have to approach a supervisor who is 30 years younger than I it is awkward.  

I deal with a Backlog of computer-related issues and Health Insurance  
Every year at the same time the backlog climbs and climbs, as it will soon start, well it's starting.

In the scope of my job, we have several things we deal with to solve the problem

Federal Laws  
State Laws  
Internal Quality Assurance  
Management Requirements - Production goals

Each STEP just creates its issue - I could for example have an issue where a person's coverage was terminated for not complying with a request to supply additional information and wants their coverage reinstated.

In the Private world, I would get the issue, and fix it, it would take me all of 10 min

In a Government Agency World it requires

1; An in-depth analysis of the request  
2: Documenting in your own words the request  
3: Documenting all notices, sent to the individual and when and what kind  
4: Searching to see if the documents are on file  
5: An outbound call to the individual up to 2 calls with at least 24 hours between each call  
6: Speaking to the individual, getting the documents if they had not already submitted them, fixing the problem while on the phone with the individual,   
7: Explain EVERYTHING that is about to happen, and how long it will take to fix  
8: Send a request to the Insurance Carrier to confirm that the transaction was received  
9: Call the member and let them know  
10: Document all calls, all actions, and the reasons: Who, What, When, and Why  
11: Copy all notes and put them onto the individual files, along with the Customer Service System  
12: Close case

12 steps in a Government job to fix a problem that takes less than 10 min.

If in the scope of your job, you identify a problem that could be resolved I suggest

1: Identify the problem  
2: explain the steps currently to resolve the problem  
3; Give at least 2 if not 3 ways to FIX and improve the resolution of that problem

Near the end of my contract I attended a four month program for separating service members to get certified in IT, specifically cloud and server administration . Halfway into the program I found out graphic design. I finished the program but instead of finding a job I moved back home and went back to school for graphic design and got an associates. I digressed a bit and joined an aviation program at a university but decided it wasnt for me and got a bachelors in communication design. 

I am now a working graphic artist and I cant imagine doing anything else not related to the creative field.

When speaking, be loud enough to be heard, but not loud, speak in a normal tone, but not monotone, when shaking hands be firm, but not painful, shake their hand like you're in control.

Stand with your shoulders straight, head up, and walk with confidence and determination but don't appear to be all that either.  Its a balance.  A simple Hello, a smile, can go a long way.

But its definitely better eventually searching for a new position vs staying at any company where you initially start.

Retail, fast food, and hospitality places are used to hiring people with no experience, so dont psych yourself out thinking youre too old compared to younger teens. Focus your resume on soft skills: teamwork (from group projects), reliability (from school deadlines), and communication (literally just being able to talk to people). If you go the RSA route for bars and nightclubs, you probably wont need a bartending course right awaymany places will start you as a barback or runner and train you on the job.

As for the job hunt, try both in-person and online. Visiting stores with your resume can show initiative, but applying online to supermarkets or chain stores gives you more reach. And dont forget places like cinemas, gyms, or even tutoring if youre good at any subjectsthey love hiring students.

They operate solely based on the project and the client. They may have some universal rules ( like bonus system, promotions and etc), but general work-life balance is strictly connected to the nature of their contract and $$$. 

For example, in one project the client will say : I need a specific number of managers, TL, Analysts, Engineers and everyone else. And the pay will be paid for the headcount. In this case it is often not that terrible, because the requirements are more or less adequate. In other cases the client just pays $$$ without any saying in hiring and WITCH tries to cut all possible costs and earn as much as possible. 

I saw it with my own eyes. The same country, the same city, the same client.

In Project A the client paid for every administrative role like TL, Manager, Trainer. The work was nice, analysts got enough support from the Leadership, the organization was pretty good. If you are hired like a Manager there, you won a jackpot.

In Project B the client didn't pay for the administrative roles, so there was a constant lack of everyone. More responsibilities, bigger teams, burnouts and chaos as a result of constant lack of resources.

These WITCH companies all suck by definition, but at the end of the day it is a gamble.","4_1"

Having that piece of paper will boost your life forever, and it doesn't matter how low your grades were to get it, as long as you finish. You can do anything you want all the time, anyway, getting it won't stop you from doing other things, but literally until you die your status in society will be higher because of that piece of paper, even if you never use it for shit. 

Best part is, you'll *never* have to do it again, either. 80 years later, if you never read a book again in your life, that piece of paper will be working for you.

*Details*:

I was an HVAC technician, myself, and now teach HVAC for the college. I have two associate degrees and am an Air Force veteran, and the fact that I have two AS (in HVAC, which only offers an AS, and the other in accounting) still holds me back daily. 

Even though I'm well into *career* I'm going to have to find a way to squeeze out another two years at university to get a bachelor's in literally *anything* so I am promoteable to the highest level in my career (which I deserve by far, it's obvious.)

I run my own business as well (HVAC, of course!), but if I had that bachelor's, the positions I could be promoted to in administration would make me massive money with half the effort. 

I also didn't know it at the time, but I should have went for engineering, instead of HVAC, because then I could get the super high income jobs designing equipment, which I could do *now* but am not allowed to, because... *associate degree.*

And don't worry about student debt. You can stave that shit off for decades, and it may be forgiven, anyway, by the government. And if you go into a public service job, you can get it written off. Make massive money as some fat administrator for the city, and ALSO get your loan written off.","15"

When we really sat down and talked about it, she just hated the program. It was not her passion and she couldnt see doing anything like that. She changed majors to things she loved and thrived - then Covid hit. She did not do well online and dropped out. She did some soul searching and realized she loved the hands on working with people things and just graduated with a degree in occupational therapy and she LOVES what she is doing. 

My son got a degree is business and it just is what it is. He uses bits and pieces of it, but ended up back in the restaurant business. Now he is in management so he is coming the two. Hes as happy as Ive seen him. 

As for taking some time off&it took me 10 years to finish undergrad then I immediately went to grad school. I found my calling then life stepped in&I had a special needs baby and we moved to another state that didnt support my MS. I went back into business and loved some, hated some, but was never super passionate about it. 

As a side hustle, Ive bartended for decades. I love it. Ive always made better money than many of my friends with fancy degrees and often more than I made in my professional capacity. 

That said&my customers who have the most expendable incomes and are the most easily employed constantly are all in trades because there is a HUGE need! When a 4 year uni degree became expected, the trade schools lost enrollment. As a result, the pricing for their services went up and they are in demand!!! They can pick and choose their jobs and make serious money. I will also add&they are HAPPY!!! They often set their own hours. Get premium emergency rates and I do not know a single person who looks down on them once they realize how much they need them!!

Example&the guy who helps me with my pool charges others $700/month for maintenance. He comes in once a week for an hour. Emergency electricians charge $300 just to walk in the house. Plumbers? Same things. HVAC? Same thing but usually more. Handyman? Minimum of $75/hour for this and that. Contractors? Thousands for a project that takes a few days to a few weeks. Septic tank company? $600 - it takes them an hour. My favorite local entrepreneur bought a trash truck. We live in an area without city trash pickup. We pay $100 month. He comes through once a week and hits 50 houses in a few hours, dumps it and starts again. 

As a mom of 4 adult children who have all gone down different paths - happiness is everything. My customers who have desk jobs or corporate jobs come to the bar to destress and complain. The contractors and trade people - come in with their teams to chill out and relax.","38"

A bunch of regards make this mistake about college. They had it easy in highschool and don't really understand how college works. This is coming from someone out of STEM too. The class room is just a quick review session or for asking questions. It's not really for learning much, you do the learning by studying for between 10 to 30 hours per test per class. A lot of regards just go into college thinking class is where the learning is done, it's hilarious, that's why they drop like flys after the first 2 semesters. I would get your bachelor's degree even if you go into HVAC just in case, remember if you leave school you only have a handful of years until those credits expire and you have to retake all of those classes all over again. If you are just in your first semester then yeah sure F it. Business is pretty easy imo, and yes I have an MBA too.

If you like reading, learning, thinking over big ideas and sharing your thoughts, then you might want to stay in uni and look around at other fields of study to find something that is a better fit.

I went the academic route because I just really enjoy gaining knowledge and putting ideas into practice. But I have lots of friends who went into the trades and they are doing all kinds of things. Some are business owners. One friend works for the city and she is like the #2 boss for all of the regions water management. One started out as a mechanic and now flies planes for spotting wildfires. One started out in construction, discovered that a lot of his buddies were struggling with addiction, went back to school for one year to get a mental health worker degree and now runs a recovery program specifically for construction workers. One was a dry Waller for a while and discovered he really likes occupational safety and got all his advanced first aid training, and now hes the on site medic.

I would encourage you to set up some time privately, in person, and share how you feel. In return, I would hope that she would be honest with you and reciprocate the dialogue.

Supply chain would be more changing fields than growing on accounting degree. Its a really awarding field and has a great outlook. Globalization and the flow of products are still going to happen during ai taking over. You might have to start over on your level. 

Whereas with data analytics that heightens everything wgu has decision making specialization that might be worth it. You could leverage that to management and stick in your field or employer. Other schools are state schools usually have a program places liken Penn state. You can see how you like it first by getting the coursera data analytics cert or go with ecornell business analytics cert. ecornell has a great interface and I would highly recommend them. I got corporate communications and getting change management certs right now. 

Other options is systems engineering. Theres going to be a lot of complicated networks in the future. Go for cpa maybe take some qualifying classes for the hours.

Statistics is going to be in demand you can use it for data analytics but the big money maker is actuary. With climate change and heightened risks theres going to be more actuaries to factor insurance premiums and banks for lending purposes. Actuaries there are tests you take. Hospitals and research also need statistics grads. 

For actuary you can take a math class on udemy for $40. There is one that is preparing you for engineering math that will be a good pick. Its basically pre calculus and lower to spruce up. If you like that take calculus then enroll in masters of statistics.

Supply chain you also dont have to an entire degree you can study for cscp exam and cpsm and exam. You just buy around 2k books and materials and study for the exams. Take them and you have the certifications. You should be able to get a job with either one. There is also six sigma if you want to work for a company that makes stuff. Villanova has a certificate program where you go from yellow to black belt. Six sigma is basically the acceptable level of defects for quality control. Six per million. 

The other options is to go project management and program management If you like managing things and people. Thats an exam after 4 years of experience called the PMP. I was able to obtain this the test wasnt that hard. Theres an entire reddit community for tips and plenty of free videos online. To get experience and get in the field coursera has a project management cert from Google or there are masters in project management but that maybe overkill once you have pmp.

Did you struggle because you were bored/not putting the work in or was it genuinely difficult to grasp? 




&gt; The college program Im looking at requires precalculus and calculus which Im worried about. It also requires linear algebra which Im ok in but its just precalculus and calculus thats worrying me.




 




I want to be clear that linear algebra is the manipulation of matrices and vectors. Sometimes people who haven't taken it yet confuse it with algebra like from high school. 


 




Business analytics specifically may get away with less math, but analytics still requires serious statistical training. Eventually, you'll want Calc. I - Calc. III, linear algebra, probability, which is mostly applied calculus II, regression, which applies Calc. III and linear algebra. Calculus I is the easiest math class you are going to take on the way to statistical learning. This brings me to my advice. 


 






If your four-year degree requires a math class, and it probably does, declare in either and take Calc. I first semester. Apply yourself fully, read the relevant sections from the textbook rather than depending entirely on lectures. Try to understand what the calculations mean, rather than just how to perform them. If Calc. I is a real struggle, then stick with marketing or another business major. If Calc. I is a breeze, then go to a departmental advisor in statistics and ask for basic data science materials and evaluate.


 






Analytics isn't oversaturated, exactly, but it is an extremely competitive field. To be competitive for mid-career roles or entry-level roles at data-intensive companies, you will need a master's degree. A lot of places near me require or very loudly prefer PhDs. This is especially true for companies involved with AI tools. You should take that possibility into account as you decide which path to go down. 


 






 




Marketing might also require a mid-career MBA for progression, but I wouldn't know. You'd have to check that out. ","3"

Additionally, this was probably true for community college, but if you're struggling with a topic, get your ass in office hours. A lot of calculus stacks on the previous material, if you have a shaky foundation, you'll get into trouble. Office hours will patch up any holes from the lecture.

I was a veterinary nurse for 10 years and was discouraged by most of the veterinarians I worked with when I was considering vet school. Their reasons being: Lots of student loan debt, comparibly low salaries starting out, terrible work-life balance, difficult pet owners. If you want to make money as a vet, go to a big city and be an emergency vet. Or do a residency in a big city and specialize in something like radiology, anesthesia, surgery, internal medicine. Know that you will be looking at another 4 years after graduating vetschool to do this, but from what I have seen-- the specialists make more money and seem a bit more satisfied with their careers. Emergency vet and primary care are difficult. Some owners are terrible and do not have the animal's best interest in mind and will prolong suffering. Some are angels and will go to the end of the world and back to do everything for their pet. There are a lot of reasons veterinary medicine has the highest rate of suicide of any health profession, atleast in the U.S. 

Human medicine is a safer bet, more money but also more schooling (unless you specialize in vet med). There is something to be said for your parents' willing to pay for your med school. Student loan debt can be crippling and take a lifetime to get out from under.

Figure out what denomination or tradition they are coming from and live the most extreme traditionalist version of it. Do your research, study your Bible, and start holding yourself and everyone who has the misfortune of working with you to impossible standards. Never get angry, but always call them out for the slightest misstep. Derail every discussion into a religious lesson no matter how tangential. Insist that every mundane decision be based on some biblical precedent no matter how obscure or tenuous. Condemn every innovation that might detract from perfecting one's faith. Lead every meeting with an eloquent but lengthy prayer that leaves little time for practical discussions. Attempt to proselytize everyone from outside the company that you deal with in the course of work. Lead Bible study during lunch breaks that always run long.

Not sure what you expected working for a 'conservative, religious company' - for all you know, the chaplain wants to discuss how the current religious environment impacts business...

Assuming they're paying you for the 1:1 time with the chaplain, again, the question is what, exactly is the intent/agenda of these sessions.

It is a tough call these days - the whole Christian Nationalist mindset has newfound freedom with the election to push their agenda (bibles in schools, etc.).

We also help interested students with college admissions guidance, as again, these students do not have parents familiar with the process. That is what DEI is. Just because you dont understand it, does not make it wrong.

Do you know what equity is? A high income student will live in an area with good schools with an excess of extracurriculars, with access to SAT/ACT prep that if not free, can be paid for by their parents, and their parents have likely completed higher education. Equity is giving those same resources to underprivileged people who dont know that they exist or cant afford them, so that they have the same shot at opportunities.

And finally, doing a mandatory module on how all people should be respected regardless of their background isnt equivalent to (presumably) forcing employees to sit with a religious figure (regardless of if they practice that religion) one on one that has 0 legal obligation to keep their conversations private. If employees share a faith and want to form their own group, theres nothing wrong with that. It becomes wrong when they want to force people to join their religion. DEI is not a religion or a belief, its typically a company policy that sums up to: respect each other.","41_2_1_1"

If the company is not offering to pay for relocation and you just happen to want to move to that area so you applied for the job, this would likely be on you.

It's going to take a long time for what you're expecting especially since you're looking for remote work without any work experience but just keep trying.

I was in a similar boat, and I did end up going back to graduate school, which I am in now. I only went back because I needed that degree to get the licensure that I want (there is a big difference in pay in what I do between having that license and not having it). 

I am one of the oldest people in my graduate course. It definitely makes me feel left out sometimes, but I am also much better than my peers at understanding these concepts due to more life experiences. If whatever career you want doesnt require you to go back to school, I would advise against it. 

For work, most job opportunities depend on who you know. Network. Use the people that you already know now to get your foot in the door somewhere. At our age, it feels like we should be able to step into a higher position, but that just doesnt happen without work experience. You are probably going to get hired in at an entry position, and have to work your way up. You will just work your way up faster than others because you have more life experience, and the drive to not be stuck there as you age. 

I would even recommend, if you can afford it, volunteering at an organization you feel strongly about. I have gotten job offers from places that I have volunteered at, because it is hard to buy passion. An employer can offer money and perks, but those perks cant buy an employees passion for the organization. A volunteer obviously has that passion, and you just need to show how you can be valuable to the company without making yourself too available. On the downside, an offer of employment is not guaranteed. But it does look better on your résumé than doing nothing.","11"

Update Your Skills: Look into certifications relevant to fields you're interested in, such as digital marketing or project management, which can enhance your employability without needing a full degree.

Volunteer or Intern: Gaining experience through volunteer work can help fill gaps in your resume and demonstrate your commitment to learning.

Network: Connect with former classmates, friends, or local community groups to uncover job opportunities and seek referrals.

Apply for Entry-Level Positions: Focus on roles that require soft skills rather than specific experience, such as customer service or administrative support.

Consider Remote Work: Look for remote job opportunities that can accommodate your transportation limitations.

It's never too late to start a new; many employers value maturity and life experience","18"
"1182","https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1h1zz0r/what_can_i_do_as_a_37_year_old_without_a_day_of/","welpwetried22","2024-11-28",1732821524,2,2,0,0,"I hear you! Its a tough spot to be in when youre looking for work after being out of the workforce for a while. But first off, you definitely *can* get your foot in the door even without a lot of direct work experience. A lot of employers value transferable skills like organization, communication, multitasking, and problem-solving. Sounds like you probably picked up a lot of those skills while managing a household, so dont sell yourself short.

As far as the whole going back to school thing, honestly, it depends. If youre considering a new direction, getting a certificate or a degree could open doors, but its not always necessary to land a decent job. Its more about what youre passionate about (or at least, what you think youd enjoy) and what fits with your lifestyle and health needs. If youre not sure yet, maybe look into some short-term certifications in areas like customer service, admin, or data entry. These types of roles often allow for remote work too, which could be a win if you're trying to avoid commuting.

Now, as for applying before updating your education, Id say why not? You might find an entry-level job that values your past experiences. I actually did something similar when I was making a career shift. I found that using an AI resume builder can be lots of help. In my case, Jobsolv helped me highlight the skills I had in a way that made me stand out more than just the plain old resume. Its a low-key way to make your experience look professional, even if its not directly in the field youre applying for.

Look for jobs that offer some flexibility, like virtual assistants, customer support roles, or remote admin work. Theyre often open to people with diverse backgrounds. And you can get a feel for the job market while figuring out what direction you want to go. Plus, if you dont mind doing a bit of entry-level work to start, it can give you some real-world experience while you explore your next step.

Dont get discouraged though. Just getting out there and applying will start building momentum. Good luck, Im sure youll find something that clicks. =L","19"

I'm 30 - was also in the IT field with no degree, got outsourced and discovered I had severe burnout. But I also don't value work in a way that it becomes the center of my world, so working 6-7 days and anything over 8 hours wasn't anything I had an interest in either.

Anyway, there are plenty of jobs you can get without a degree, or possibly an associates degree if you have the motivation to push through the 2 years. 

You could always do insurance estimation (cert), property management (cert/license), get into auto body or automotive electrical/tuning, any office administrator, management, customer service, or the likes. 

The hard part is finding out what you want to do exactly and how to break into that field, which ultimately comes down to you connecting with people in that field and getting contacts so you can have some form of reference. 

You should spend a couple hours researching careers that you can find on indeed and zip recruiter that don't require a degree or minimum of an associates, and look into them more on your own. We can't decide for you what to choose, but you have to find something that resonates with you and you can tolerate for another 30 years.","2"

Life gets overwhelming, and figuring out a career path when youre not fired up about anything is super tough. Honestly, it sounds like youre craving stability and something that doesnt drain your soul.

Community college could actually be a great option. A lot of programs there are short, affordable (sometimes free), and lead directly to solid jobs. Stuff like HVAC tech, medical billing, or even something chill like office admin work might be worth a look. These fields dont always need crazy-long hours or degrees and can give you that security youre looking for. You could also try talking to someone at the college. Career counselors there usually know their stuff and can help you narrow things down.

If youre really stuck, one thing that helped me was updating my resume to make my skills stand out even when I wasnt sure what I wanted. I used Jobsolv to pull it together because it made me see how my random jobs actually added up to something valuable. It wasnt a magic fix, but it gave me the confidence to apply for jobs I wouldnt have otherwise considered. And yeah, its good for making sure your strengths pop.

For now, just keep it simple. Look for roles that fit your vibe: decent pay, no brutal hours, and something you can grow into. You dont need to have your whole life mapped out, just the next step. Baby steps, man. Youll get there.","4"

It takes all your random work experience, skills, and even stuff you didnt think was valuable and helps you organize it into something that actually stands out. Like, it doesnt just list jobs. It highlights what makes you good at stuff in a way that hiring managers actually care about.

It also helped me figure out how to position myself for jobs that were kind of out of my league because it made me see my work in a different light. Like, even stuff from delivery gigs or admin work had transferable skills I didnt think about before.

Its not just about slapping something together, either. It feels modern and legit, so your resume doesnt scream I used the same template as everyone else.

You could look at electrical fitting maybe. That is an apprenticeship though, so it depends on whether you want to do that.

Yea, that's not a world view that's really consistent with success in big tech. You ply your craft on a very big team, with lots of indirection, and serve a monolith that makes decisions on lives of people without any personality. You can't get caught up in all the what if scenarios of ""poor collective outcomes in the long run"".

Be a soldier, and do your f'ing job, especially when it sucks, because it's something worth doing.  If there's enough in that job that you enjoy doing or find fulfillment in, helping people along the way, and building things that people use, you can thread a needle of meaning through the sea of bullshit.

That's sort of my view: I'm a builder. I make things and help people do the same.

Unfortunately, as you mentioned, education is not really valued as a society, which then makes educating young minds a more monumental task. Additionally, social media has reduced the attention spans of children significantly, which makes it even more difficult. Instant gratification is hard to compete with. Beyond this, the general behavior problems in class can derail the flow of class and those feelings of success.

Teaching takes a special breed of amazing human, and at this point, I am not sure I am that person. I dream of a job that I can clock out of and really not worry about doing anything until my next shift. While CSR might not be a noble profession, this role is in an educational company that makes pretty decent quality materials to educate students. The company was also formed by teachers and looks for teachers to fill it's ranks.

With that said, there are definitely downsides that I am considering, hence the conundrum.

After finishing, you can explore Rad Tech programs, which would align with your interest in healthcare and offer solid pay with a manageable schedule. The key imo is to complete your B.S. first to avoid leaving unfinished degrees, which can be a red flag for some employers.

In the meantime, you could also look into entry-level remote roles in customer support, tech support, or admin that might not require extensive experience but can help ease your financial burden.

Hard skills would be things like report-writing, building newsletters, developing and implementing training programs, scheduling, presenting/public speaking, navigating security systems such as cameras and alarms. Im totally open to certifications to develop more specific hard skills.

Softer skills are patience, working well with a wide range of people (ie, everyone from museum directors to music industry folks), communication, attention to detail.

My work experience is mainly in security, though Ive worked in education via Americorps and through an internship. My security jobs have mainly been in museums and concert venues. These are typically hands-off, unarmed gigs that require attention to detail and customer service more than physical security. I was a supervisor for a year until mass layoffs at a former job.

You are right that devoting more time to finding a job with the same resume will likely get you better results. But you gotta realize that the added work experience actually helps a lot with finding a better job. Almost nobody starts out in their desired end position unless you have a very specific degree for it. 

I'm actually currently in a similar boat and I chose to take the lackluster job and just job search in my downtime. I think it was definitely worth it for my specific circumstances. If you believe you're qualified enough to get the job you want now in a reasonable time frame then sure go for it, but the job market is rough right now and many people (both workers and future hiring managers) believe any job is better than no job. Even if it's a completely unrelated field, it gets you a paycheck and shows you're willing to work and can hold a job. 

Also I don't know what field you're trying to get into, but if you do end up quitting (which is a valid option) and it's applicable to your field, you should look into spending some of your time to get certifications that will help your resume.","1_1_1"

So depending on how you look at it you'd be between 3 and 7 years ahead of me.  Not that I'm any kind of gold standard for an optimal career trajectory, but I am proof you can make a decent life for yourself even if you didn't follow the prescribed plan.

Sometimes surviving gets in the way of preparing for the future.  Sometimes the future just seems really far away and you think you have time, then all of a sudden you're 27 and questioning what to do next.

I sure as fuck didn't know what I wanted to do at 18 when I got out of high school.  I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life when I dropped out of college when I was 22.  I survived the rest of my 20s with the love and support of my family and friends.  Started a family (wife and 1 kids when I went back to school at 30).  Graduated at 34 (with 2 more kids) and have done progressively better (Again with a lot of help and support from family and friends).  

I still don't know what the fuck I'm doing, but I look a lot better on paper at 50 than my 20 year old self would have thought.  

I can look back and wish I'd finished school the first time.  I can think I'd be better off financially, if I had waited to have kids until after I was started in a career.  I can look back and easily question everything I've done and all the choices I've made and what it all comes back to, for me, is what can I do to make my life better today.  

If you can start a career at 27, don't wait until you're 28.  If you're not ready for a career at 27, then do what you need to make it until 28, and check your options again.  Whatever you do, don't beat yourself up over the past (I did that for a while) and don't try to change the past - it won't work.","33"

You mentioned you wanted to become a PT but sort of lost the passion.  Have you looked at a PT assistant? You already have a bachelors so should just be two semesters to get the cert. Usually tech schools have afternoon classes allowing you to continue working. Pay in Georgia is about ~60k so roughly 32$ an hour.  

If you still have an itch to become a PT (or any type of healthcare provider nurse md etcetera) but providing financially is the main concern. Look up HPSP VA scholarship. The VA will pay you a monthly check and pay for schooling so long as you agree to work for them for X amount of years. Doesnt require enlistment!

If you were completely sober and the claim is false you have a few options. I would recommend the following, go to your employee handbook or check what the it drug policy says. Read their harassment policy. Understand what the companys guideline is and make sure to point out how they are not following. Someone cant just accuse you and that is it. Sounds like the supervisor doesnt know how to process such a claim.
Go to HR, write an email stating what happens and send it to your personal email. Make sure you state you were sober and felt uncomfortable how the supervisor approached the situation. How they are not following their on policies or rules. 
If they have a hotline to report inappropriate behavior call it and say what happened. Document on your end when and what you said on the call. 
If you need to make a claim because they did not respond appropriately do it. Could be with the EEOC or check how your local labor law protects you. If the worse happens: Let them fire you if they are so dumb to do so. You will probably win unemployment and continue the claim and if you can talk to a lawyer (you can do this step anytime).

But to do another one just because some random person made up an accusation? So you have to get all up in my life just because some other person said so? Idk.

I think tossing out slander/ harassment is better. Theres no proof for 1, theres proof for the other

If you can somehow make it a tangible thing and not just what someone else said - cause thats not going to be much proof

Unfortunately the proof for ""damage"" is proving that what was said harmed your reputation and then you were punished for that.

But if the job never punishes you, then theres not proof

The majority of high paying, decent work life balances, stable job description with occasionally interesting days, that's relatively straightforward for biology majors to get is something in healthcare/allied healthcare. Anything else has more risk to it, and more care and attention is needed with plotting the right career path. 

Biotechnology in my opinion is a bit dependent on the individual person, it can be quite easy or hard. I think you have to research this pathway very thoroughly/look for previous people who were successful here or had the  career you want, and try to get a feel for if it suits you. 

I heard psychology is a decent career but can be highly competitive to get into. 

I don't know much about neuroscience but I'm guessing it's more like biotechnology and you have to research it in particular/find previous people who had careers you liked there and see if you think you can replicate it. 

I think biology and psychology don't have much math, but I'm not sure about biotechnology or neuroscience. 

If I were you I'd try to go for something in healthcare where the subfield of biology relevant to it is interesting so you'll always have a stable career, and read up on your interests in either of those subjects in your spare time. I know lots of people who had a stable job and spent 1-4 hours a week (not much over a week) reading up a field of their interest, who did it for decades, and they were content with this pattern. And maybe they would find more opportunities in their field of interest later on, but with a stable career they could fallback on later. I think it could give the same amount of satisfaction as pursuing a more risky career in a niche field. 

Good luck with everything!","1"

Psychology opens up paths in clinical work, counseling, or even areas like organizational development. Neuroscience could take you into research, healthcare, or cutting-edge fields like brain-computer interfaces, though it might involve some quantitative work depending on your focus. Biotech is biology-heavy but can require more math, so it might be worth looking into specific programs to see how much math youd actually need. If youre passionate about biotech, dont let math scare you off entirelymany roles are more lab-focused and less about complex equations.

Since youre weighing options and want something exciting and fulfilling, you might find the GradSimple newsletter helpful. They feature interviews with grads who talk about their academic choices, career outcomes, and how they navigated big decisions like this one. Its a great way to see how others found their paths and what lessons you can apply to your own choices.","3"

Even if they do let you go(which they can) it still a resume booster at the end of the day. Make up some excuse. Say they laid off the entire department and you got caught up in the mess.","5"

I dont even remember the name of the intern I had back in say& 2018& just do your best. Learn what you can. Ever company is different with different goals structures, requirements.

Yea it is rough, but you gotta focus on building up your resume so you can use this job to get your first real one","5_1_1"

Most companies include some kind of clause that lets them part ways if things arent working out. But that doesnt mean its a done deal in your case. Youre still there, and until you hear something directly from them, its not over.

The fact that theyre revisiting your emails and posted a new opening could mean a lot of things. It might not even be about you. Maybe theyre expanding the team or just planning ahead. But if youre feeling behind, its not a bad idea to check in with your manager and ask for feedback. It shows youre proactive and willing to put in the effort. It could even shift how they view you.

While youre still there, keep showing up and giving it your best. If they do decide to let you go, its not the end of the world. Internships are about learning, and sometimes things just dont click. For the next opportunity, consider something that aligns more with your pace or learning style. Ive been in situations where things didnt pan out, and honestly, thats how I found Jobsolv. It had a mix of higher-quality roles, including hybrid ones, that didnt feel overwhelming. Its worth checking out if you want something solid to fall back on.

And hey, dont psych yourself out. Youve already made it through their selection process, which means youve got potential. Take this as a learning curve, not a dead end. Stay focused, keep communicating, and see where it goes.","6"
