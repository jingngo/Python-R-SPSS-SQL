# Beginner-level projects using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Sci-kit learn
Date posted: 09/02/2024
I completed these projects with instructions provided by 연세 겨울 AI챌린지 and Coursera. With a passive fluency in Korean, I translated public dataset provided in Korean to English and afterwards applied suitable EDA methods and visualization. This repository is one of my first ever attempts to gain more Python fluency and learn how to use data to support decision making in business.
